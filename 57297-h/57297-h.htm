<p>At the corner of a lofty housetop overlooking a
great part of Cairo, a woman stood with arms
uplifted and solemnly addressed a crow which
seemed about to settle. The bird, as if the meaning
of the chant had reached him, turned in the air
with clumsy flapping, and withdrew, rising to join
the hundreds of his kind which circled high above
the city bathed in early sunlight. The woman
shook her fist at his receding shape, glass bracelets
tinkling on her strong brown arm. She sighed,
“The curse of God on thy religion, O thou faithless
messenger!” then, with a laugh, turned round to
join the group of slave-girls, her companions, sent
up to lay out herbs to dry upon the roof. These
had watched her invocation of the crow with knowing
grins. But one, a young Circassian, who sat
watching while the others worked, betrayed surprise
and asked the meaning of the little ceremony.</p>

<p>At that there was much giggling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a>[Pg 6]</span></p>

<p>“Knowest thou not, O flower? It is the woman’s
secret!”</p>

<p>“Secret of secrets, all unknown of men!”</p>

<p>“By Allah, men know nothing of it. In sh´Allah,
they will be astonished some day!”</p>

<p>“O Hind, relate the story! Our honey, our
gazelle, Gulbeyzah, has not heard it.”</p>

<p>Thus urged, the one who had adjured the crow,
a free servant of the house, obsequious towards
the slaves, its pampered children, explained as she
knelt down again to work:</p>

<p>“In the name of Allah, thus it is related: Know,
O my sweet, that, in the days of our lord Noah
(may God bless him), after the flood, the men and
women were in equal numbers and on equal terms.
What then? Why, naturally they began disputing
which should have the right to choose in
marriage and, as the race increased, enjoy more
mates than one. The men gave judgment on their
own behalf, as usual; and when the women made
polite objection, turned and beat them. What
was to be done? The case was thus: the men
were stronger than the women, but there exists One
stronger than the men&mdash;Allah Most High. The
women sought recourse to Allah’s judgment; but&mdash;O
calamity!&mdash;by ill advice they made the crow
their messenger. The crow flew off towards
Heaven, carrying their dear petition in his claws,
and from that day to this he brings no answer.
But God is everliving and most merciful; a thou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a>[Pg 7]</span>sand
years with Him seem but an hour. Perhaps
He does but hold our favour over, as might a son
of Adam, till the evening for reflection, to grant
it at the last. In sh´Allah!”</p>

<p>“In sh´Allah!” came the chorus of a dozen
voices; followed by a general laugh when Gulbeyzah,
the Circassian, yawned and sighed, “Four
goodly husbands all my own! O Lord, give
quickly!”</p>

<p>“That is the reason,” Hind concluded, “why
good women have a word to say to crows who seek
to settle. Any one of them may be the bearer of
the blessed edict. The reason as related&mdash;Allah
knows!”</p>

<p>“Good news and hopeful, by my maidenhood!&mdash;the
best I ever heard!” chuckled Gulbeyzah,
reposing with her back against the parapet. She
then remained a long while silent, lost in day-dreams.</p>

<p>The hour was after sunrise of a spring morning
in the twelve hundred and eightieth year of the
Hegirah, the second of the reign of Ismaîl. The
house was that of Muhammad Pasha Sâlih, a
Turk by origin but born and bred in Egypt, who
held a high position in the government. The girls,
their task accomplished, sat down on their heels,
each with her tray of basketwork before her, and
sniffed the breeze, in no haste to return indoors.</p>

<p>“Praise to Allah,” one exclaimed with fervour,
“we escape for an hour from that Gehennum there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a>[Pg 8]</span>
below. Never have I seen the lady Fitnah so enraged.
Her wrath is not so much because her
son desires the English governess, as because the
Pasha sees no hindrance to the match. I tremble
every time I have to go to her, lest in her fury she
should damage my desirability.”</p>

<p>“Praise be to Allah, I am not her property,”
replied another, “but that of her durrah, the great
lady. Yet I know her for a good and pious creature,
not likely to be so enraged without rare cause.
They say this foreign teacher has bewitched the
young man. He is mad. He flung himself before
her in the passage as she came from driving. She
spurned him, and they bore him, senseless, to his
chamber, where for two days he weeps and moans,
refusing nourishment. It is enchantment, evidently,
for the girl is ugly.”</p>

<p>“Nay, by Allah, she is white and nicely rounded.
But shameless! But an infidel!”</p>

<p>“She can change her faith.”</p>

<p>“As easily as dung can change its odour!”</p>

<p>“Gulbeyzah here is whiter and more appetizing.”</p>

<p>“Well, God alone knows what she is or is not.
This is sure: I have no itching to go down into the
house while Fitnah Khânum rages.”</p>

<p>“Nor I!” “Nor I!” exclaimed the rest with
feeling.</p>

<p>The morning clamour of the city came up to
them as a soothing murmur. Minarets dreamed
round them in the sun-haze which was rosy at its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a>[Pg 9]</span>
heart but in the distance pearly with a tinge of
brown. On one hand open country might be seen,
green fields and palm trees crowding to the desert
wave on which three pyramids stood out, minute
as ciphers; on the other, ending the long ridge
of the Mucattam Hill, arose the Citadel in smoky
shadow, its Turkish dome and minarets, its towers
and ramparts, appearing like a city of the sky.
Here and there among the housetops a small cloud
of doves went up, fluttered a moment and subsided
peacefully. Kites hovered, crows were circling,
in the upper air. Gulbeyzah watched their
evolutions dreamily.</p>

<p>“Allah defend us from the liberty of Frankish
women!” she remarked at length. “I could not
bear it. To meet the stare of all men were too
dreadful. My maidenhood would flush my brain
and kill me. O pure shame! And yet they choose
what men they like, the fact is known. In sh´Allah,
the great favour, when the crow does bring it, will
not destroy our blessed privacy.”</p>

<p>“In sh´Allah, truly!” answered Hind, with
vehemence. “Fear nothing, O beloved; God is
greatest! Their freedom is from Satan, their liege
lord&mdash;the curse of Allah on him! It is a travesty
of God’s work, like all he does. Is it not known
when Allah made the cow, he tried his best to do
the same, but got no farther than the water-buffalo?
All Heaven mocked him. Our charter, when it
comes, will be perfection.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a>[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>“Talking of foreign women makes me curious
to know how things are going, down below. Has
the governess consented to give life to Yûsuf?
Has the Pasha quieted the lady Fitnah?”</p>

<p>“Nothing could quiet her, unless it were the
quick expulsion of the Englishwoman. Why did
she ever have her children taught the lore of
infidels? The fault is hers! She hoped to keep
the Bey from honourable marriage, chaining his
fancy with some slave-girl, her own creature.”</p>

<p>“With me, say plainly!” laughed Gulbeyzah,
with a yawn. “I was brought into the house
with that intention. Yet not her creature, for
Murjânah Khânum is my mistress, and she would
have seen to it that I was well respected. If the
governess has pity on him&mdash;which I think not
likely&mdash;as soon would the wild serpent wed the
dove&mdash;my lady must provide me with a proper
husband. I have no mind to wither as a fruit
untasted.” She yawned again. “Will no one
go into the house and bring me news?”</p>

<p>Up leapt a little Galla girl, a child as yet unveiled,
all eyes and teeth with glee in the adventure.</p>

<p>“I go, O lady! I am not afraid. I will even
enter the selamlik. I will find out everything.”</p>

<p>“Be very careful, O Fatûmah, lest old Fitnah
seize thee. She would rip up thy belly and pluck
out thy entrails did she catch thee spying!”</p>

<p>The little black girl laughed and made an
impudent grimace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a>[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>“And then the eunuchs! They will surely beat
thee.”</p>

<p>“By Allah, they must catch me first. Sawwâb
adores me, and the others are too slow.”</p>

<p>“Good. Run, ere curiosity consume me!”</p>

<p>The little negress shot off like an arrow. Down
dark, malodorous stairs, through empty corridors,
she glanced, incarnate mischief. In a pleasure
court of the harîm, where orange trees in tubs
grew round a pool, she stopped to listen for the
voice of Fitnah. It came from an apartment on
her right. Straight forward, where she wished to
go, the coast seemed clear. Springing on tiptoe,
she plucked a spray of blossom from the nearest
tree; then ran on down a passage through the
ornate screen, the boundary of the women’s
quarters, where a eunuch tried in fun to stop her;
and in sight of a great hall where men were
lounging, knocked at a door.</p>

<p>The word had scarce been given ere she glided
in and held out the sprig of orange-blossom to the
English governess, with every muscle of her body
fawning, smiling. Without a look, she read the
stranger’s face, perceived she had been crying
lately but now looked exultant, observed the
order of the room, the foreign furniture; and
then, before the Englishwoman could find words to
thank her for the pretty offering, kissed a white
hand which proved as hot as fire, and darted out
as noiselessly as she had entered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a>[Pg 12]</span></p>

<p>As she was flitting back across the garden-court,
she heard a male voice cry:</p>

<p>“Be silent, woman; or, by the Prophet, I
shall have to beat thee!”</p>

<p>Crouching behind a tub, she listened eagerly.
But though a wrangle was in progress not far off
between the Pasha and his wife, the lady Fitnah,
she could glean no more than the main tenor of it
from the voices, of which the man’s was irritated
and the woman’s mad.</p>

<p>At last the Pasha shouted:</p>

<p>“It is finished. No word more. I go straight
to the Consul. Appeal to the Câdi, I beseech
thee; of thy kindness, do so! He will tell thee,
just as I do, that thou art demented.”</p>

<p>Another minute and he crossed the court,
wearing his best tarbûsh and his official garb of
black frock-coat and narrow trousers&mdash;a thing
unheard of at that early hour.</p>

<p>Having seen him pass to the selamlik, Fatûmah
ran like lightning through the dim old house, till,
breathless, she emerged in dazzling sunlight and
flopped down on the roof again beside the others.</p>

<p>“Well, what news?” they clamoured.</p>

<p>“Great news!” Fatûmah panted. “Only listen!
The English governess is going to marry Yûsuf
Bey, and she has islamed!”</p>

<p>“Praise to Allah!” cried the others in amazement.
“A Frankish woman convert! A great
miracle!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a>[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p>“The Pasha goes this minute to the English
Consul, to confer with him and make arrangements
for the ceremony.”</p>

<p>“Allahu akbar! Is it possible? But what says
Fitnah?”</p>

<p>“What can she say, the poor one? The
command is on her.”</p>

<p>“But, for the love of Allah, say, how didst
thou learn all this?”</p>

<p>Fatûmah shut her lips tight, looking preternaturally
cunning.</p>

<p>“Ha, ha!” was all she answered.</p>

<p>“Her tale is nonsense! She is making game
of us,” exclaimed Gulbeyzah, breaking out in
laughter. “She was not gone five minutes, that
is known. Thou shalt be paid full measure, little
poison-flower! Confess now that thy story is all
lies!”</p>

<p>The marvel was that every word proved true.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>


<p>Muhammad Pasha Sâlih was intensely worried.
As he drove toward the English Consul’s office,
he let deep furrows ravage his benignant brow,
and combed his long grey beard with nervous
fingers. The ever-shifting crowds, the eager faces,
the laden camels rolling on like ships upon the
sea of heads; the water-sellers clinking their brass
cups, the cries of salesmen and the floating odours&mdash;all
the pageant of the streets and all their rumour,
which filled the sunlight and seemed one with it,
went by unnoticed.</p>

<p>In youth he had been wedded to a noble Turkish
lady, the sweetest and most gentle of companions.
Never an angry word had passed between them.
But, alas! when all her children died soon after
birth, Murjânah Khânum had grown melancholy
and retired from life. She still dwelt in his house,
was still the nominal head of his harîm; but for
more than twenty years she had been dead to
pleasure. At first he had amused himself with
pretty slaves, being reluctant to infringe her
dignity of only wife. Then, at her instance, for
she feared debauch for him, he had espoused the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a>[Pg 15]</span>
daughter of a wealthy native, whom the caprice
of a former ruler had exalted. The marriage,
besides raising his importance, had brought him
four male children. Yet at this moment, with the
curses of the termagant still ringing in his ears, he
almost wished he had let well alone and kept to
concubines.</p>

<p>Allah knew that Yûsuf’s malady was not
uncommon at his age; the cure self-evident.
The governess was not a heathen. She was of
those who have received the Scriptures, therefore
marriageable. Moreover, being, as he shrewdly
guessed, of no consideration in her native land,
she might be tempted by a life of wealth and
ease. To save his son from death, he had besought
the Englishwoman, imagining that her
consent would fill the house with joy-cries. Yet
when the cause was won, the only possible objection
cancelled by the girl’s unlooked-for turn to
El Islâm, behold! the lady Fitnah’s grief was
changed to fury. The wrangle with her had
perturbed him at a moment when he stood in
need of all his wits to brave the Consul. Well,
Allah saw what trials he endured!</p>

<p>The carriage drew up in a quiet alley, before
a gateway ornamented with a coloured picture
of lions great and small in funny attitudes. Two
Cawasses in silver-braided jackets with long dangling
sleeves rose from stools beside the threshold
and saluted. Muhammad Pasha passed between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a>[Pg 16]</span>
them, crossing a courtyard to a second door, wide
open like the first. There, in a whitewashed
room, two Copts sat at a table, cutting pens.
They both sprang up at recognition of the visitor
and strove to kiss his hands, which he prevented
by patting each upon the shoulder kindly.</p>

<p>“Is the Consul busy, O my children?” he
inquired. “I have an errand of importance.
Please inform him.”</p>

<p>“Upon my head. I go at once, by Allah!”</p>

<p>One of the Copts leapt to an inner door and
knocked thereon. Enjoined to enter, he opened
it just far enough for the introduction of his
body, and slipped in. Anon returning in the same
respectful manner, he beckoned to the Pasha.
Then he flung the door wide open, and stood
aside, with eyes downcast and hands demurely
folded.</p>

<p>Muhammad Pasha entered with a beating heart.
His mission was of essence delicate, and he was
anxious to avoid all odour of offence towards a
foreign representative possessing influence. Having
touched hands with the Consul and exchanged
greetings, he sat down on the extreme edge of a
chair, and toying with his amber rosary, thus
broached his business:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Monsieur le Consul,”&mdash;the conversation was in
French of the Byzantine school,&mdash;“you remember
the young lady whom you were good enough
to recommend as an instructress for my children.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a>[Pg 17]</span>
Can you inform me of her origin, her previous
history?”</p>

<p>“Excellency, I only know what she herself
confided: that she was educated at a religious
institution for poor children of good family.
She has no relatives. She came here to be governess
in an English house which, by the father’s sudden
death, was brought to poverty two weeks before
she came. She found herself here without a
situation and with little money; and as she
was well recommended and impressed me as
respectable, I thought of you, remembering that
you desired an English governess. I trust that
you are satisfied of her efficiency?”</p>

<p>“Altogether. She has been a month now in
our house, and almost is become like one of us.
She is so charming. It is there, the trouble.
She is ravishing. Monsieur le Consul,”&mdash;here
the Pasha changed his tone for that of one who
bares his heart, discarding courtesies,&mdash;“I am
very gravely troubled. The anxiety I suffer
cuts digestion and gives me frightful belly-pains.
My son adores this demoiselle, and she adores him.
The affair deprives me of all taste for food. You
see my sufferings!”</p>

<p>“Continue, Excellency!” said the Consul grimly.
He got up from his chair and paced the room.
The Pasha kept the corner of an eye upon him,
as he proceeded:</p>

<p>“What can I do? The demoiselle has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a>[Pg 18]</span>
secluded from my household, as I promised you.
But youth leaps boundaries; love can speak
through walls. My son has seen her in the passages&mdash;their
eyes have met&mdash;What know I? Youth
is fatal.”</p>

<p>Here the Pasha wiped his eyes.</p>

<p>“Monsieur le Consul, when I heard of this two
days ago, I put my son in prison; I went myself
and reasoned with the demoiselle. I have reasoned
with them both, entreated, threatened; but without
result. I fear my son will die if he may not
espouse her. The demoiselle implores me not
to cast her forth. She says&mdash;it is so touching!&mdash;that
we are her only friends, that she never met
with kindness till she came to us.”</p>

<p>“Beg her to come this afternoon and see me,”
pronounced the Englishman, whose face had
darkened by perceptible gradations as he listened.</p>

<p>“That is precisely what I come to ask: that
you will scold her. God knows how the responsibility
has weighed upon me. She is not the
match I should myself have chosen for my son;
but still I should be glad of the alliance, because
of the esteem I have for all the English. I stand
impartial in the case and greatly worried.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Excellency. Send her to me
this afternoon. Is there anything else?”</p>

<p>The Pasha had already risen to depart.</p>

<p>“One thing.” He dropped his voice to a stage
whisper. “In the frenzy of her love she asks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a>[Pg 19]</span>
to be of our religion. She has made an oath of
her conversion before witnesses. (The Consul
swore.) But have no care. We will forget it, if”&mdash;the
Pasha laid great stress on the condition,
and for once looked boldly in the other’s eyes&mdash;“if,
after consultation with you, she should wish
to recant.”</p>

<p>“But you say that there are witnesses to her
conversion,” cried the Frank, with bitterness.
“I fail to see how it can be forgotten. There
would be a riot.”</p>

<p>“The witnesses are of my house,” rejoined
the Pasha suavely. “My command is guarantee
of their discretion.”</p>

<p>“Send her to me!” The final words were
uttered from tight lips beneath a formidable frown,
as the Consul flung the door wide open for the
Turk’s departure.</p>

<p>“Sont-ils fanatiques, ces brutes-là? Peuh!”
respired the Pasha, shaking the dust from off
his boots as he regained his carriage. “The girl
will have a cruel hour, poor floweret! That
dog would like to kill her. But, God be praised,
the law of El Islâm is still sufficient to protect a
convert in a Muslim land!”</p>

<p>His thoughts of the lone foreign girl were full
of kindness. She was his daughter. He would
care for her true happiness. And then the thought
of Fitnah’s rage, recurring, caused him to frown,
and swear, and gnaw his underlip.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>


<p>Immediately on his return to his own house,
Muhammad Pasha sent a eunuch to announce his
coming to the lady Fitnah. He found her lying
on a couch in her state-room. Two slaves, who had
been busy fanning her, retired before him. Seeing
she lay still with eyes closed as if quite exhausted,
he drew near and whispered:</p>

<p>“Now, in sh´Allah, O beloved, thou wilt hear
my reasons.”</p>

<p>She opened great brown eyes, bloodshot with
wrath, and glared at him a moment.</p>

<p>“Well, what news?” she asked, with studied
coldness.</p>

<p>The Pasha then embarked upon his story; but,
at mention of the Consul, she sprang up with rage
renewed, expectorating:</p>

<p>“Curse thy father! ‘She will see the Consul,’
sayest thou? The Consul! May the Consul and
his whole race rot with agony! It is simply to
evade a duty which is thine and thine alone.
Eject her from the house at once, thou paltry
coward! She will kill our son. I know thy
guile, by Allah! Thou wilt say, ‘The Consul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a>[Pg 21]</span>
orders her to marry Yûsuf. We must obey the
Consul,’&mdash;O salvation!&mdash;when all the while thyself
art father of the mischief. Oh, let her not come
here, or, by my fruitfulness! these hands shall cling
to her and not leave hold till they have made her
so that no man could desire her.”</p>

<p>Expostulation proving vain, her lord retired in
great annoyance. He had to fear a scandal in his
house, an inquisition by the Consul, ignominy, if
Yûsuf’s mother came in contact with the English lady.</p>

<p>In this dilemma, as in every other which concerned
the household, he went for counsel to his
only love and first of wives. He sent a herald
of his coming to Murjânah Khânum, and after a
decent interval repaired to her apartments. She
received him in a large room, with no other solid
furniture than a low desk on which a manuscript
of the Corân lay open; but exquisitely clean and
sweet, a contrast to those quarters of the house
where Fitnah reigned. The windows were constructed
of the finest lattice-work, which made the
light within seem rare and delicate. Murjânah,
old but stately, fondled her lord’s hand.</p>

<p>“Thy face is careworn,” she exclaimed, perusing
it. “In sh´Allah, all the news is good.”</p>

<p>“In sh´Allah,” he replied mechanically. “But
Allah knows that I am greatly troubled. I know
not what to do.” And he proceeded to describe
the madness of the lady Fitnah. At the tale’s
conclusion, a light laugh surprised him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a>[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p>“Thou askest what to do,” exclaimed Murjânah,
“when there is danger that a foolish woman, mad
with jealousy, may harm a guest of ours! Hear
the word of Allah: ‘When ye have cause to fear
their disobedience, ye shall reprimand them, ye shall
banish them to beds apart, and ye shall beat them.’
Is not that plain? Beat her! It is thy sacred
duty. No, no, she will not cry against thee to the
Câdi. She will hide her fault. All women look to
men for government, and if it is withheld, have
cause of grief. Trust me, beloved, there is no good
woman who would not rather suffer stripes occasionally
than grow for lack of them into a shrieking
harridan. Fitnah Khânum is my durrah, and I
love her truly, as the mother of our darling children,
and for many virtues. Still I say to thee on this
occasion: beat her soundly. Bestow on her a
perfect beating, O my soul!”</p>

<p>The Pasha kissed his old wife’s hand submissively,
and went forth from her presence with a face of
awe. The high proceeding needed courage, for a
man so kindly. He went to the small chamber
where the eunuchs sat when not on duty, and called,
“Sawwâb! Meymûn! Bring me a big kurbâj.
Attend me, both of you!”</p>

<p>The silent, swift obedience of those servants
showed the impression made by his unusual sternness.
Their help was necessary that the scene to
come might wear the aspect of an execution, not a
struggle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a>[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p>Whip in hand, Muhammad Pasha crossed a courtyard
and entered a small room remote from others.</p>

<p>“Bring Fitnah Khânum hither secretly!” he
told the eunuchs.</p>

<p>Sawwâb, the fat, was seized with trembling;
while Meymûn, a tall, gaunt creature, gave a deathlike
grin. They sped, however. Three minutes had
not passed before the lady Fitnah, deftly bound
and gagged, was borne into the lonely chamber
and the door was shut.</p>

<p>Half an hour later, Muhammad Pasha Sâlih sat
conversing with the English lady, preparing her
intelligence to meet the Consul’s arguments, which
he forewarned her would be all misstatements born
of blind fanaticism. When married to Yûsuf, he
assured her, and himself believed it, she would
hardly know the difference from an English home.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a>[Pg 24]</span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>


<p>The English girl, meanwhile, experienced a
passionate elation, like new life. The Pasha’s
exhortations were not needed. Rebellion, which
had always lurked beneath her trained subservience,
now clothed her in its flames and made
her terrible for any one who dared assail her new-found
pride.</p>

<p>What had she to regret? From childhood she
had been repressed, humiliated, and ordered to
be thankful for bare daily bread. In Christian
families her lot had been unenviable. Here, in
this Muslim household, she was somebody. The
month spent here had been the happiest in her
life. But, bred up to regard employers as a race
apart,&mdash;impressed, moreover, by the grandeur of
the house and by the rank of Pasha,&mdash;she had never
dreamt of being thought an equal by her entertainers.
When Yûsuf Bey, whom she had noticed
for his beauty, assailed her in the hall, she had
imagined his intentions far from honourable,
judging from past experience in English houses.
She had fled to her own rooms, ashamed and angry,
while the image of his face alight with passion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a>[Pg 25]</span>
remained to trouble her against her will. When
the Pasha came and begged her in most flattering
terms to condescend to marry his unworthy son,
she nearly swooned. All her resistance sprang
from incredulity. When once convinced that the
demand was earnest, she gave way with grateful
tears. Then her resolve became a living faith.
It was to break the bondage of the past completely,
to cast in her lot for ever with these friends who
wanted her.</p>

<p>They were wealthy, of exalted rank, and yet
they wanted her. They thought her lovely, who
had always been esteemed entirely plain, with her
squat figure, apple cheeks, and sandy hair. The
sleekest youth in all the world desired her. It
was so marvellous that she was forced to rub her
eyes and fix their gaze on homely objects to dispel
the sense of some enchantment. The difference of
religion gave her no concern; indeed, the change
was welcome, she had been so cramped by English
pietism. In this mood, she was fire against the
Consul. A world of happiness was opened suddenly,
and there were those who would debar her from it
Woe betide them!</p>

<p>The Pasha himself escorted her to where a harîm
carriage waited. Sawwâb the eunuch held the
door for her.</p>

<p>“The carriage will be there to bring you back,” the
Pasha told her. “I have ordered the servants by no
means to return without you, upon pain of death.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a>[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p>The implied suspicion that she might be kidnapped
made her laugh.</p>

<p>“Remember, my son’s life is in your hands&mdash;such
pretty hands! His earthly happiness is
trusted to this carriage, all too vile to hold so sweet
a burden. Day and night he dreams of nothing
but your charms. If your mind changes he will
surely die.”</p>

<p>She laughed and kissed her fingers to the
dear old man, as she stepped up into the
carriage. The eunuch slammed the door, which
was close-shuttered, leaving her in perfumed
shade. A burning blush suffused her as she
thought of Yûsuf&mdash;his strained, eager face, his
yearning lips, beheld that once to haunt her
consciousness, a naked shape of love. But pride
was uppermost in all her thoughts just then&mdash;pride
in the comfortable carriage, the attentive
servants&mdash;pride in her new-found value, in her
new-found relatives, and in the daring resolution
she had made to break with England. The foreign
clamour of the streets, the curious, heady odours,
flattered her with a sense of strange adventure.</p>

<p>Radiant, she alighted at the gate which bore
the royal arms of England, near which an open
carriage also waited, and passed into the Consul’s
office. She expected sternness, but the Consul
smiled agreeably, and after shaking hands with
her, took up his hat.</p>

<p>“I have been thinking,” he observed, “that all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a>[Pg 27]</span>
I have to say could be much better said by some
one else&mdash;a woman. I should be hampered by
embarrassment.” He smiled. “So, if you don’t
mind, I have sent a note to Mrs. Cameron, asking
leave to bring you out to tea with her this afternoon.
I have a carriage at the door.”</p>

<p>“I also have a carriage,” she replied, with a
light laugh, as they went out together. She could
not but admire his strategy, for Mrs. Cameron,
the leader of the English colony, was a gentlewoman
of the straightest Christian outlook, the
last person whom a renegade would care to face.
She had, moreover, been all kindness to the
stranded girl, hospitably entertaining her until she
found a situation. Since going to Muhammad
Pasha’s house the governess had spent a Sunday
with her, and heard warnings. To brave her now
would be an ordeal, but no matter. The destined
bride of Yûsuf scorned all fear.</p>

<p>Out at the gate the Consul eyed her carriage with
intense disfavour, especially Sawwâb the eunuch,
who stood ready at the door.</p>

<p>“You will kindly come in mine,” he said peremptorily.</p>

<p>“Then you will kindly tell the Pasha’s man
to follow,” she replied, with eyes that twinkled
laughter at his show of temper.</p>

<p>He shouted to the Pasha’s coachman, and got
in beside her. For a while they drove in silence,
the Consul stealing glances at her face from time to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a>[Pg 28]</span>
time. She knew that he was struck by the new
charm of her. His manner had a dash of gallantry
which was amusing.</p>

<p>“I hate to see you in that carriage, with those
servants,” he exclaimed at length impulsively.
“You must forgive me. I have lived here years,
and know the country.”</p>

<p>Again she laughed and her eyes quizzed him.
The thought that she knew more than he did,
possibly, was made conviction by his next remark:</p>

<p>“Please realize that you are absolutely free.
Whatever may have happened&mdash;I mean whatever
influences have been brought to bear&mdash;those people
cannot hurt you now, or even reach you.” This
man who knew the country suspected the good
Pasha of iniquity, and looked upon his palace as a
den of vice. She said:</p>

<p>“There has been nothing of the kind. I have
never been so kindly treated or so happy.”</p>

<p>He hemmed and hawed, remarking:</p>

<p>“Well, remember what I say. And don’t forget
that, as a British subject here, you have great
privileges which, whatever happens, you will be
unwise to forfeit. I hope you will confide in Mrs.
Cameron. There is no one in this world more kind
and trustworthy.”</p>

<p>She answered, “Thanks!” and turned from him
to contemplate the passing scene. Their carriage
flew along a sandy lane between walled gardens of
the suburbs, with here and there a mansion closely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a>[Pg 29]</span>
shuttered towards the street. The road was
covered with the long procession of the fellâhîn
returning outward to their villages&mdash;men straddled
over donkeys between empty paniers; women
stalked erect and queen-like in their graceful
drapery; here and there a camel sauntered, led
by some bare-legged boy&mdash;the whole, obscured by
clouds of dust, illumined warmly by the rays of
the declining sun, or steeped in the deep shadow
of mud walls. Foot-farers, forced aside to let the
carriage pass, stared at its inmates with contemptuous
eyes. The garb of Europe was a blot
upon the peaceful scene. Her heart went out to
all those people, plodding, contented, in the sunlit
dust. Henceforth she would be nothing strange to
them, she swore it.</p>

<p>“Here we are!” The Consul’s voice disturbed
her reverie. He shouted to the driver and the
carriage stopped. The harîm carriage drew up
close behind it. A door in a high wall was opened
by a smiling negro. A minute later she was in a
cool verandah, looking on a well-kept garden, outside
a very English drawing-room.</p>

<p>It was a house where all was tidy and precise,
a hostile element to one in love with the untrimmed
profusion of the Pasha’s palace. She hated it as
servants hate a nagging mistress.</p>

<p>“Now, having brought you two together, I shall
leave you,” said the Consul pleasantly. “This
young lady, Mrs. Cameron, has gone and got her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a>[Pg 30]</span>self
into a precious fix. Confess her thoroughly,
and then we’ll find some way to get her out of it.”</p>

<p>“But I have no desire to get out of it,” cried the
girl, exasperated. “The fix, as you are pleased to
call it, is my greatest happiness.”</p>

<p>But the Consul was already gone, delighted as it
seemed to wash his hands of her. She found herself
alone with Mrs. Cameron.</p>

<p>“We’ll have some tea at once, and you must see
the children,” was that lady’s first remark, so
different from the attack anticipated that the
guest, all nerved for battle, felt defrauded. Though
ready to resist with fury, she lacked the energy required
to open fight. Tea came, and with it the
three tow-haired children, whose presence made all
talk impossible. The girl sat moody, in abeyance,
replying briefly to remarks addressed to her. The
garden perfumes became stronger as the sun sank.
They, or some kindred but more subtle influence,
obscured her brain with fumes in which her purpose
loomed unreal and enormous. The homely scene
appealed to her against her will. Almost she
had the sense of hands held out to her, while Mrs.
Cameron was talking nonsense with the children.
This playing on her nerves seemed a mean stratagem.
Hot anger grew beneath her careless shell.</p>

<p>At length the youngsters were dismissed. The
girl then braced herself to meet the blow. Again
she felt a keen pang of deception when her hostess
said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a>[Pg 31]</span></p>

<p>“I am going to ask you a great favour. Stay
the night with me! My husband is away at
Alexandria. I am really lonely.”</p>

<p>“Thank you very much, but it is really quite
impossible,”&mdash;there was poison in the honey
of this sweet reply,&mdash;“I have a carriage
waiting.”</p>

<p>“We can send it with a message.”</p>

<p>“No, really, thank you! I have stayed too long
already.” She suddenly bethought her of the
master move, and rose determined.</p>

<p>“No, sit down, my dear!” cried Mrs. Cameron.
“I have to talk to you. And though I would
rather have had the night in which to think things
over, I must, since you force me to it, speak quite
simply now. I say: Don’t do it, child! Don’t
take the step the Consul tells me that you contemplate!
He thought that you had been seduced
by unfair practices; but that, I see from your
behaviour, is not so. It is just the charm of
novelty, the spirit of adventure&mdash;is it not?&mdash;with
just, perhaps, a little mischief prompting, a little
grudge against the dull life you have led. My love,
you must not be allowed to do it&mdash;you, an Englishwoman!
It degrades us all. I have lived out here
for years, and I assure you that, if a daughter of
mine declared her will to marry one of them, sooner
than it should happen I would kill her with my own
hands. A girl!&mdash;It is unheard of! With their
view of women!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a>[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p>“It is plain you know nothing about them,”
sneered the other; “at any rate, about the
class of people I have mixed with. They have
the greatest reverence for women. You suppose,
because we veil&mdash;”</p>

<p>“We!” interjected Mrs. Cameron.</p>

<p>“Yes, we; for I am one of those whom you
so grossly slander.” A drum of battle beat at
either temple of the girl thus brought to bay. Her
brain reeled with indignation, and her voice grew
husky. “I say, you think because we veil that
we are quite degraded, the same as we do when we
see your faces bare. The difference is one of
custom only. Underneath our veils, in our own
houses, we are just as happy and as free as you
are.... It is too droll! You fancy that Mahometan
women have their lives made miserable?
Why, I have never known such happy women.
From my rooms, I hear them laughing, playing,
singing all day long.”</p>

<p>“Poor things! They know no other life.
You do, and would be miserable in the same conditions.
Have you ever thought of what polygamy
involves&mdash;for women, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“It seems to me extremely sensible and kind to
women. It takes into consideration facts which
we slur over, cruelly. It gives to every girl a
chance of motherhood.”</p>

<p>“My dear!” exclaimed the mentor, greatly
shocked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a>[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t care what you think. It is quite true.”</p>

<p>“You are young and inexperienced. We who
live in the country hear of things of which you
cannot possibly know anything&mdash;things that I
wish most heartily that you may never know.
That is why I beg of you earnestly to change
your mind.”</p>

<p>“Nothing will make me do that.”</p>

<p>“Then you are honestly in love, and we will
say no more on that point.” The forbearance
was so unexpected that the governess was startled
and stared at Mrs. Cameron with unbelieving
eyes. The elder lady showed such trembling
earnestness that she grieved for the necessity to
shock and wound her. “There remains another
question, on an altogether higher plane&mdash;I mean
the question of religion.” Mrs. Cameron’s voice
turned awestruck. “The Consul tells me&mdash;but
oh, no! It is too fearful!”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why!” returned the other doggedly.
“They worship God as we do, and they count
Christ as a prophet. They are no more fearful
than the Unitarians in England. And I am sure
they think much more about religion in their
daily lives than people do at home.”</p>

<p>“They deny the essence of Christianity&mdash;the
Redemption. How can you turn your back upon
that marvel of Divine Love? Their ideals are all
much lower, more material.... My dear, I see
that you have come here primed with specious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a>[Pg 34]</span>
arguments, and I regret that I am not clever
enough to make you see their falseness. I wish
I had the tongues of all the angels at this moment
grieving over you, to show you how terrific is the
gulf you view so lightly.”</p>

<p>The girl laughed nervously. “I don’t suppose
the angels bother much. You talk as if God only
cared for Christians. I’m sure He thinks the
Moslems just as valuable. If you are so much
better, why don’t you mix with them and try to
do them good?”</p>

<p>“Some of us are doing so.”</p>

<p>“In such a way!...”</p>

<p>“We are not discussing missionary methods,
dear. Your case is the only one before us.”</p>

<p>“Well, you say that missionaries mean to do
good in their way; but it never seems to strike
you that I may hope to do a little good in mine!”</p>

<p>Her tone grew plaintive; the long contest
wearied her. The bloom of shadow on the garden,
underneath the rose of sunset, the voices of the
evening made her wistful; while the sadness
which attends all partings clutched her heart.
The whine of doing good had slipped from her
at unawares&mdash;an echo from her former life of
hired hypocrisy. It had been the natural tone
of conversation with a lady of the class “employer.”</p>

<p>“That rings untrue. You’re simply talking
for effect!” cried Mrs. Cameron, indignant. “It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a>[Pg 35]</span>
is unkind when I am speaking from my heart
of hearts.... Now, only one word more. If
you ever loved any one&mdash;father, or mother, or
friend&mdash;at home in England, think of that person
and just ask yourself what he or she would think
of your denying Christ. The act is so uncalled-for
that it seems like wanton wickedness. You can
marry your Mahometan without renouncing Christianity,
and by so doing you would have more
honour in your husband’s eyes. You could
retain your status as a British subject, which means
something here; and if you really have a purpose
to do good among those people, you would be
in a better position to do so than by sinking to
their level.”</p>

<p>“I won’t hear a word more! Oh, you are
brutal!” The girl started up with hands and
teeth clenched, past endurance. “Oh, you are
brutal to bully me like this! I tell you once for
all, I love those people, whom you and all your
kind hate and tell lies about. No one was ever
really nice to me before. They are a million
times better than any Christians I have ever
known. I tell you I belong to them, and not
to you! I mean to have the same religion as my
husband, and if he goes to Hell, well, I’ll go too!
Do you understand?” Her words now came
in gusts, for she was sobbing heavily. “You’ll
never see me any more, of course, for I’m a wicked
Moslem and you’re so fanatical! I don’t care;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a>[Pg 36]</span>
I can do without you. I have truer friends, who
really like me and don’t only patronize. Oh, how
can you make me cry like this, when I was so&mdash;so
happy!”</p>

<p>To her surprise, she found herself in her
tormentor’s arms.</p>

<p>“You wrong me, dear. I’m not fanatical, nor
yet so narrow-minded as you think. Now, will
you promise that, whatever happens, you will
look upon me as a friend and come to see me
sometimes? I have said all I can to dissuade
you, because I fear you may repent of your decision
when too late. My hope is, now and always, that
you may be happy. You’ll promise, won’t you,
still to make a friend of me?”</p>

<p>The girl nodded, sobbing, speechless with
emotion.</p>

<p>“Well, then, God bless you, dear, among the
Moslems, and may you always bear the standard
of true Christian womanhood!”</p>

<p>With that two-edged blessing in her ears, the
renegade, a bowed and shrinking figure, traversed
the garden in the blue of twilight. She felt
guilty and unnerved, irresolute, until she saw the
Pasha’s carriage waiting in the lane, when pride
returned. The tears yet wet upon her cheeks,
she stood erect and sniffed the evening air. There
was still much traffic on the sandy road, running
between dark garden-walls to where, beside a
little dome, a single palm-plume stood up black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a>[Pg 37]</span>
against the sky. The dust kicked up by donkeys’
hoofs, by people’s footsteps, rose greenish like
wood-smoke. Some wayfarers already carried
lighted lanterns which made coloured circles in
the gloaming like the peacock’s eyes. A life of
passionate adventure lay before her, most curious
and rich and warm with human failings, much
better worth than that which she had left behind.</p>

<p>Sawwâb the eunuch held the carriage door for
her, and murmured “Praise to Allah!” as he
shut her in. She saw him merely as a well-trained
servant, having as yet no inkling of his
grim significance.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>


<p>Muhammad Pasha Sâlih went again to see the
Consul, this time upon receiving a peremptory
summons. He came away with smart sensations
of indignity, the unbeliever having warned him to
take care of his behaviour to the English governess.
The marriage contract, he was told, must be in
order, and every detail of her treatment strictly
honourable. These admonitions thrown as to a
dog, to him, the known embodiment of goodness,
made him cry. When he got home it was to find
a note from the Grand Câdi, requesting him to call
at once upon that dignitary, who besought him,
for the honour of the Faith, to be precise in all his
dealings with the English convert. And when, that
afternoon, he waited in his duty on the lord of
Egypt, that prince demanded tidings of the
Englishwoman and, jesting, told him to be sure
and use her kindly.</p>

<p>“She must be a rare pearl,” the sovereign
chuckled. “The English Representative is maddened
by her loss. By God and His Apostle, I
have half a mind to snatch her from thee.”</p>

<p>For one whose house had always been a guarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a>[Pg 39]</span>
sanctuary, who never made nor brooked the least
allusion to his women, such language from licentious
lips, in hearing of the throng of courtiers, was
sheer ignominy. He cursed the parents and
religion of the English Consul, the cause of this
indecent noising of a private matter. The dog
appeared to fancy that he had to do with fellâhîn
or small officials; for he had spoken of the facility
of divorce and the danger of the Englishwoman
being cast adrift. Among the vulgar there were
men who changed wives constantly, even persecuting
her they had till she herself besought the
Câdi for release, thus forfeiting the dowry which
was justly hers. Such men might be, who thought
it clever to defraud poor maidens. But that any
one could think that he, Muhammad Pasha, or a
child of his, could harbour such iniquity seemed
barely credible. The hot tears stung his eyeballs
at the thought of it.</p>

<p>“Just Allah!” he exclaimed within himself.
“Does he suppose that we have no morality?
Would he, whose native customs are as shameless
as the ways of beasts, leaving females unprotected
and at large, instruct us how to cherish and to
guard a woman? He talks as if I were some pimp
or ruffian, when I am dealing with the maid as
faithfully as if she were my only child!”</p>

<p>In truth, before this trouble with the Consul, at
the ceremony of betrothal, when he himself had
prompted the bride’s proxy, he had assigned to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a>[Pg 40]</span>
a dowry of three thousand pounds&mdash;a sum sufficient
to make Yûsuf hesitate, however angry, before he
gave the order for divorce. He had, moreover,
spoken to his son most gravely, pointing out the
friendless state of the young woman, and informing
him that if he took her it must be for life. Yûsuf
had made frantic answer in the way of lovers,
comparing his fidelity to stars and blossoms. The
Pasha bound him by a solemn oath always to show
forbearance to his foreign wife. He then drove him
forth to spend the time until the wedding in a
cousin’s house; where, as he had heard this afternoon
from the said cousin, Yûsuf kept raving of his
love&mdash;in abstract terms, for decency&mdash;till the whole
selamlik was infected with the trick of sighing.
Nothing could have been more honourable than
his conduct. The girl was better off than ever in
her life before, and knew it. He swore an oath
to let the Consul know it too.</p>

<p>Accordingly, returning to his house that evening,
he craved immediate audience of the sometime
governess; and shortly entered her apartments,
which, providing simply for an upper servant of
his house, he had furnished in the Frankish manner
to seem homelike. If he had gone to so much
trouble for a stranger’s comfort, was it likely he
would prove a niggard towards his dear son’s
bride? The pig who thus traduced him must be
taught.</p>

<p>The girl was sitting in a chair beside the window,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a>[Pg 41]</span>
reading an English book. It pleased him to
reflect that she was highly educated. In these bad
times, when Frankish lore was in demand, her
instructions might secure advancement to a man
like Yûsuf, who knew French already.</p>

<p>She laid aside her book and rose to meet him
with a charming blush. He took her hand and
raised it to his lips; then sank down on a chair
and clasped his brow.</p>

<p>“Ah, mademoiselle!” he moaned, “I am so
troubled. God knows my heart is sad, profoundly
wounded. You are kind and generous, and you
know our hearts. But those others of your nation.... Pouf!
How bitter! How fanatical! They
treat me and my house as dirt. Here is the case:
You honour my poor house; you are alone; you
have no parents. I say to myself, ‘She is an orphan;
I will be her father.’ I therefore do what parents
do according to our customs. I provide the trousseau;
I also bargain with the bridegroom’s people
to endow you richly.</p>

<p>“Let me explain what that means, since it must
be quite unknown to you. With us, divorce is
easy; it suffices for the man to say a little formula;
but the husband must support the wife for three
months afterwards, and he must pay the balance of
the dowry stated in the marriage-contract, or, if
no portion has been paid beforehand, then the
whole of it. That makes him think. And the
greater the dowry, the longer will he meditate before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a>[Pg 42]</span>
divorcing her. Now I, your father, have talked
the matter over with myself, the bridegroom’s
father, and have obtained for you a dowry of three
thousand pounds Egyptian. This sum will be
stated in the contract, signed and sealed before the
judge, and my son will have to pay it if ever he
desires divorce, which God forbid! Your trousseau,
with the jewels and the slaves that I am going
to give you, the furniture of these rooms and more
which I shall buy to supplement it&mdash;I wish your
house to be the kind you are accustomed to&mdash;all
this, I say, will be your absolute property, and
so stipulated in the contract.”</p>

<p>The girl had seized his hand. She pressed it to
her lips and sighed:</p>

<p>“How good you are!”</p>

<p>His own emotion was no less than hers. The
humiliations of that day had taxed his fortitude,
and the sense of his integrity beneath aspersion
was like a bubbling fount of tears in outer darkness.
The warm touch of her gratitude unmanned him
quite. He sobbed aloud:</p>

<p>“Ah, mademoiselle! God knows that I have
done my best! Yet here is the Consul threatening
me, and moving all the Government to watch me
closely; as if I had entrapped you for some evil
purpose!&mdash;as if I were the worst of criminals,
intent to harm you!... I cannot vindicate
myself. It would be too degrading. And if he
thinks me such a first-class <i>canaille</i> he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a>[Pg 43]</span>
not believe me. Therefore I come to beg you,
mademoiselle, yourself to deign to write a little
word to this good monsieur, assuring him that we
are not the monsters he supposes.”</p>

<p>The girl’s face flamed. “I write at once!”
she said, and rose to do so.</p>

<p>But the Pasha cried: “One moment, mademoiselle!”
He wiped his eyes and struggled to
recover firmness. “Do not suppose that I complain!
Even if the happiness of my dear son were
not concerned, I would suffer more than this&mdash;much
more&mdash;abominations!&mdash;to serve so beautiful and
good a lady. I fear my words have saddened you.
Oh, God forbid! Never, I pray you, think of it
again, your letter written. You must be all happy.
To-morrow you must go among our ladies. You
will find there mothers, sisters, longing to embrace
you. They will help you choose the stuffs for
your trousseau. They speak Arabic, of which
you know few words as yet, or Turkish, which is
quite unknown to you. But my widowed sister
speaks a little French, and Murjânah Khânum
owns a young Circassian who can talk it fluently.
She is a present from relations in Constantinople
who have bred her from a child in every elegance.
At the time of the great war with Russia, French
was much the mode; even girls learnt it, and this
maid of whom I speak, Gulbeyzah, talks it well.
She shall be attached to you as interpreter. The
wedding, if it please you, can take place next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a>[Pg 44]</span>
week. We will have it in the mode of Europe&mdash;nothing
barbarous!”</p>

<p>“I love your customs!” she replied. “Let it
be just as if I were a native bride.”</p>

<p>“No, no,” remarked the Pasha, with a chuckle.
“There are many usual ceremonies here in Egypt
which are condemned by our religion, strictly
speaking. These we shall exclude, preserving only
one or two which may amuse you. My son also
will modify his life to suit your foreign standards;
it is only just; although the life of our own ladies
is by no means terrible, as you will find. Tomorrow
you shall spend in the haramlik. You
will find there many friends. All, all will love
you and make glad your heart. And now, with
your permission, mademoiselle, I shall retire.
Forget not that small letter to the Consul.”</p>

<p>Muhammad Pasha, coming from that interview,
was traversing the hall of the selamlik towards his
study, when a sudden clamour at the house-door
startled him.</p>

<p>“Curse thy father! Wait, I say! Be still a
minute!” cried the doorkeeper; while another
voice yelled madly, “I must see the Pasha.
Where is he? Let me pass, I say! The need is
urgent!”</p>

<p>“Cut short thy life! Wait only! Are these
manners? He has entered the harîm, I tell
thee!”</p>

<p>There followed sounds as of a struggle, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a>[Pg 45]</span>
before the Pasha could divine the meaning of the
uproar, a youth in poor attire rushed in and fell
before him, panting:</p>

<p>“He told me to win to thee, O my lord&mdash;to
fight my way through armed hosts if necessary, to
seek thee even in the secrecy of the harîm, saying
that the letter which I bear would be my full
excuse.”</p>

<p>It was a poor familiar of the palace, named
Ghandûr, one who from early childhood had been
Yûsuf’s humble shadow, a youth so simply honest
in his judgments that to subtler wits they wore
the look of imbecility. But yesterday he had
been here as usual, sitting in the entrance on the
watch for Yûsuf. To-day he had been absent,
but without disloyalty: he had been sitting in the
entrance of the house where Yûsuf sojourned
temporarily.</p>

<p>“He bade me run, and Allah witness I have
done his bidding. I am thy slave, give pardon,
O my lord the Pasha!”</p>

<p>“Salvation be upon thee, O Ghandûr. What
letter, now, is this of which thou speakest? Give!”</p>

<p>Reassured by the kind tone, Ghandûr arose,
and smiling with a flash of perfect teeth, produced
a letter from his bosom, touched his forehead
with it, then reverently laid it in the Pasha’s outstretched
hand. It ran:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“My garden of delight is in thy custody. The
palpitations of my heart inform me danger shadows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a>[Pg 46]</span>
it. Alas! the grievous power of jealousy, which
can make of a gazelle a tigress, and turn a mother’s
love into a sword. This is the third time I have
written to thee, yet no answer. Say that thou
hast taken measures to preserve my lovely blossom
from envious trampling and from poisoned
water....”</p></blockquote>

<p>The Pasha crumpled up the letter and stood
wrapped in thought. Coming so close upon his
promise to the English girl that all the women in
the house would love and cherish her, the warning
had a flavour of fatality. He recalled the lady
Fitnah’s frowardness. She had been punished.
Who could say that she had changed her mind?
And, with the Consul’s evil eye upon the house,
the shame of any outbreak would be doubled.</p>

<p>“Run to my son!” he told Ghandûr. “Assure
him that a guard is kept, none safer, under Allah.
Bid his soul have rest.”</p>

<p>Having watched the youth depart, he called
the eunuchs and ordered them to guard the English
lady as their life. Then he proceeded to the
kitchens and there gave command that every dish
and drink prepared for the table of the governess
should come first to him that he might taste and
judge its quality. And he took good care to let
the women know of this precaution.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>


<p>The women’s quarters were a rambling place,
with three small courtyards all on different levels,
tunnels, staircases inside and out, and passages
which ran in all directions. Besides the ladies
Fitnah and Murjânah and their households, a
widowed sister of the Pasha, and a former slave
who had enjoyed his favour, kept separate state,
with children and attendants. Freed slaves and
poor relations, recognized go-betweens and sycophants
came in and out, and slept there when
they chose&mdash;a privilege extending to their offspring.
Old women with a secret, knowing look
edged through the corridors; untidy children
sprawled upon the stairs; outside the door of each
of the great ladies stood rows of coloured slippers,
signifying humble callers. The place seemed
always populous and full of noise. In a sense,
good order reigned there; but it was the order of
a township rather than a private residence, including
all degrees of cleanliness, of wealth and squalor.
The corps of eunuchs, ten in all, were the police.</p>

<p>This little world of women had its liberties.
From the third hour of the day until the sunset<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a>[Pg 48]</span>
call to prayer, the lord of the harîm was absent.
If he happened to return, it was his duty to
announce the fact beforehand, allowing time for
visitors to veil and slip away. The inmates had
their private interests, their games and jokes.
The clash of tambourines, the quick soft beat of
darabukkahs made a pulse of glee. They all
seemed happy and in love with life, although they
hardly ever saw the sun or breathed free air; for
when they drove abroad it was in shuttered
carriages; and the family mausoleum, where they
went for picnics, was a second palace with its own
haramlik.</p>

<p>But what surprised the Englishwoman more
than anything was the charm of majesty&mdash;the
exquisite prestige&mdash;which certain of these Eastern
women radiated; making her feel small. They
called her “Barakah”; it was her name thenceforward,
and meant a Godsend, so the courtly
Pasha told her. That name increased her awkwardness
at first, sounding sarcastic from the lips
of queenly women.</p>

<p>On the morning after she had written her
indignant letter to the Consul, she was awakened
by soft singing. A beautiful and stately girl sat
by her bed, who, seeing her at last awake, sprang
up and kissed her. Murjânah Khânum, claiming
Yûsuf’s bride as her own guest until the wedding,
had sent her slave Gulbeyzah to attend her to the
bath, attire her in a robe of honour (which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a>[Pg 49]</span>
shown), and then escort her to Murjânah Khânum’s
rooms, where Barakah was asked to breakfast and
to spend the day. It was useless to resist. Gulbeyzah
knew her duties, and performed them
scrupulously. By the time they left the bathhouse,
Barakah arrayed in gorgeous silk, her
fingers hennaed and her eyes enlarged with kohl,
they were laughing friends.</p>

<p>Murjânah Khânum took the Englishwoman in
her arms and kissed her; then sitting down
beside her, subjected her to a prolonged inspection,
none the less embarrassing for being tender.</p>

<p>“Ma sh´Allah!” she exclaimed, and added
some soft words in Turkish, looking to Gulbeyzah,
who translated:</p>

<p>“Madame says you are more beautiful than she
was told. Your beauty is more excellent than
the rose. Your eyes remind her of the Bosphorus.
You make her think of her own country. The
desire which you inspire is like home-sickness.”</p>

<p>Barakah could only blush and hang her head&mdash;a
posture which drew down fresh compliments upon
her modesty.</p>

<p>Slaves brought in trays of fruit and set them
down, retiring silently. Then an old negress
came in with a brazier and made coffee, with
which was served a kind of fritter smeared with
honey. Then a young girl appeared with ewer
and basin and fine towels, going first to Barakah,
who rinsed her hands. Murjânah and Gulbeyzah,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a>[Pg 50]</span>
she saw afterwards, used soap and washed their
teeth as well&mdash;a cause of spluttering.</p>

<p>Murjânah Khânum rolled a cigarette. She
lounged at ease with eyes intent on Barakah, and
while she smoked, gave vent to her reflections,
which Gulbeyzah rendered into French as best
she could.</p>

<p>“It is a great distress to me not to be able to
convey my loving thoughts directly to the mind
of one so near. Ask the dear one if she speaks
Romaic, or a little Persian. No? A pity! She
is learning Arabic? In sh´Allah, she will soon
acquire that tongue and Turkish too....</p>

<p>“I fear she must feel strange and lonely in a
life so different: I wish I could expound its beauty
to her. Ask her whether she has read the
tragedies of Sophocles, an ancient Greek. No?
That surprises. I had thought them known among
the Franks. Say, I have read them in the Turkish
version and admired them greatly.... At least, she
knows that, in old times, before the prophets,
there were priestesses who guarded mysteries of
the false gods?... Well, we secluded women of the
East are the guardians of the mysteries of God
Most High&mdash;the verities of life and death, of
birth and growth and of decay&mdash;of all those things
which come directly from the hand of God. These
are the sense of life; though much obscured by all
the surface agitation which disturbs the life of men.
We, in our calm retirement, always view them ...</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a>[Pg 51]</span></p>

<p>“And then, when one regards the strife of tribes,
the tumults and rebellion in this world, is it not
well that womanhood should be kept sacred and
aloof, respected in the strife of Muslims&mdash;the ark
which bears the future of the Faith?... Then,
even as it is, much crime is caused by love and
jealousy. What would it be if women went
unveiled? I say not, in her land where men’s
blood may be more equable; but here.... Just
Allah! Youth would be a curse. If marriageable
girls were barefaced, what could preserve them
from atrocious accidents? We guard their youth
and train them to be lovers, child-bearers; we
send forth healthy boys to serve the Faith....</p>

<p>“Tell her that I myself, by Allah’s visitation,
have lost all my children; yet, thanks to El Islâm,
I am not desolate. I have her Yûsuf and a score
of others for delight.”</p>

<p>Hearing these words translated by Gulbeyzah,
Barakah felt abashed to insignificance. The habit
of confronting the brute facts of life, which
Europeans cover over, clothed this old woman in
a tragic grandeur which was almost terrifying.
She was relieved when other ladies came and
talk grew shallow. Silks and fine linen fabrics
were spread out before her. Hearing that she
was required to choose among them for her
trousseau, she implored Gulbeyzah with despairing
gestures to say that she resigned selection to the
ladies. The answer caused relief. The ladies set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a>[Pg 52]</span>
to work methodically, feeling, stroking, comparing
the materials in the best light, discoursing all the
while like happy birds. Fitnah Khânum was less
forward than the others in politeness, and kept her
face averted from the gaze of Barakah. She took
her leave before the service of the midday meal.</p>

<p>The Pasha’s widowed sister begged of Barakah
to spend the following day with her in her apartments.
Murjânah was approached and gave
consent.</p>

<p>“I can give you dinner on a proper table with
chairs and knives and forks,” the widow said in
broken French.</p>

<p>Murjânah Khânum’s tables were brass trays on
little stands, and everybody ate with fingers from
the dish.</p>

<p>The day with Leylah Khânum was less serious.
The widow’s talk was all of love and lovers. A
perfect host of go-betweens was kept employed to
find her a fresh husband; but, though ageing fast,
she was fastidious and asked perfection.</p>

<p>“God grant she may not die a widow,” sighed
Gulbeyzah, who explained the case to Barakah.</p>

<p>Leylah Khânum was much exercised to know
whether Barakah had had much love-experience in
England. Hearing “No,” she raised her hands in
marvel. One so beautiful! The mistress of so
much charm! And unveiled among men! She
asked the reason.</p>

<p>“I was poor,” said Barakah.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a>[Pg 53]</span></p>

<p>At that there was loud outcry; Leylah Khânum
and Gulbeyzah called on God for pity.</p>

<p>“But you are beautiful! Men pay for beauty,
need no bribe with it. And you mean to say they
would have let you die a virgin&mdash;with that loveliness?
O Lord of Heaven! What a wicked waste!”</p>

<p>Their dread of dying in virginity appealed to
Barakah as something comical when she remembered
the ideals preached in Christendom.</p>

<p>Leylah Khânum told her stories of true love, all
far from proper judged by English taste; and
shocked her by the cool assertion that poison was
a woman’s natural weapon. In the afternoon
they were invited to Murjânah Khânum’s rooms,
where the business of the trousseau still proceeded.
It went on for days. Each morning when she
woke, the bride-elect found some fresh present
from the Pasha in her room, which Gulbeyzah
made her carry forth and show to every one. The
whole haramlik frolicked round her in excitement.</p>

<p>Gulbeyzah’s status in the household puzzled
her. The Circassian seemed the equal of the ladies,
yet was called a slave.</p>

<p>She said to her one day:</p>

<p>“You are as white as I am. How can you bear
to be a slave like Wardah or Fatûmah?”</p>

<p>“Not like Wardah or Fatûmah, if you please!”
was the superb rejoinder. “They or their fathers
were captured in a warlike raid and made to islam,
I, God be praised, was born in the Faith. Look!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a>[Pg 54]</span>”
she cried, and with a splendid gesture bared her
bosom. “This is the paste of which they make
sultanas. My parents sold me&mdash;they were poor&mdash;that
I might come to honour, as others of the family
have done before me.”</p>

<p>“But what chance have you here? Do you
expect to captivate the Pasha?”</p>

<p>“God forbid! I never even see him. Here I
serve the sweetest of all ladies, who will one day
find me a rich husband. It is a famed harîm, and
my lady is renowned for goodness and refinement.
The greatest in the land would not disdain a fair
Circassian girl of her instructing.”</p>

<p>“But do you never miss your freedom? You
can form no projects, being, it seems, entirely in
the hands of others. Surely your thoughts are not
so ruly? You must sometimes dream?”</p>

<p>Gulbeyzah fixed her great eyes on the questioner
as though debating whether she were to be trusted.
Then, with a smile, she grasped her hand and
whispered, “Come!”</p>

<p>She led the English girl across the court where
grew the orange trees, down a foul-smelling passage
towards the kitchens, and up a flight of stairs into
a corridor which served the chambers of the
humblest servants. In its wall was a recess with a
small window neither barred nor latticed. Here
Gulbeyzah stopped.</p>

<p>The reason why that window had been left uncaged
was plain, since it looked out upon blind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a>[Pg 55]</span>
walls and distant housetops. But one small angle
of a terraced roof appeared within clear seeing
range, and on that angle sat a man. When Gulbeyzah
leaned her elbows on the window-sill, he
sprang to his feet and made despairing gestures.
She watched his antics for a moment, then drew
in her head.</p>

<p>“It is a secret, mind!” she cautioned Barakah.
“I spent an afternoon here once, when I was sulky,
and he was walking on that roof by chance. Ever
since then I see him every day. He always sits
there. I sign to him to climb up, but I know
he cannot.” She laughed scornfully. “I make
romances in my mind about him. It is evident
he dies of love. He has grown thinner.”</p>

<p>“How cruel! How can you torment him so?”</p>

<p>“He is a man, you understand. One does not
feel compassion as one would for girls. Perhaps if
he could climb up here I should reward him, but,
thanks to God, he cannot, poor young man!”</p>

<p>“But are you not ashamed to think such
thoughts&mdash;you, the pupil of Murjânah Khânum?
So immoral!”</p>

<p>“It is my fancy, there! Morality is not our
business. We are strictly guarded. One gets a
conscience&mdash;what you call a soul&mdash;when one has
children. How droll you are! You talk just like
a man. God knows I love you, and should like to
be your durrah.” (The word means colleague in
the married state.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a>[Pg 56]</span></p>

<p>Gulbeyzah flung her arms round Barakah. A
sound of footsteps in the passage made them turn
and peep.</p>

<p>“It is a eunuch!” the Circassian whispered.
“He has been there all the time. He attends you
like your shadow, have you noticed? How sweet
to be so precious; and so respected, for he keeps
his distance!”</p>

<p>Barakah preferred these confidences with Gulbeyzah
to the endless fuss and noise about the
trousseau. The hive was in commotion over the
approaching marriage; angry, Gulbeyzah told her,
with the Pasha for his wish to shear the festival
of ancient ceremonies regarded as the woman’s
right. When approached upon this subject in a
crowded conclave, she said that she was anxious to
conform to all their customs&mdash;an answer which
was hailed with cries of triumph.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cameron appeared one afternoon, the Consul’s
envoy, to ascertain that all was well with the
perverted girl. She was shown to the state-room,
and there regaled with tea in glasses and sweet
biscuits, in what was thought to be the English
manner. The ladies pestered her with eager
questions, persisting, despite frank denials, in
regarding her as a near and dear relation of the
bride. She glanced reproachfully at Barakah
from time to time. “You’re quite at home with
them, I see,” she said at parting. “It sounds
unkind, but I must say I wish you weren’t. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a>[Pg 57]</span>
a fall for any woman bred as you were. How can
you put that kohl round your eyes?... Good-bye,
my dear, and don’t forget our compact.”</p>

<p>The visit leaving an unpleasant, sad impression,
Barakah withdrew to her own room, alleging
headache. She was lying on her bed with eyes
half closed, endeavouring to lay the ghost of former
days, when some one entered without knocking,
shut the door with care, and crept towards her.
It was a strange old woman. She sidled up with
much grimacing; whispered “Yûsuf,” laid her
shrivelled cheek upon her hand; “Yûsuf,” again,
and smacked her lips delectably; “Yûsuf Bey, thy
bridegroom,” and made the motion of embracing
with ecstatic grins.</p>

<p>Barakah grew interested. She longed to see
the man she was to marry and, fresh from Mrs.
Cameron’s reproach, was feeling reckless. She tried
to question the old woman, but without result.
The crone kept nodding, “Yûsuf Bey” and
“Come.” She had brought with her a habbarah
and mouth-veil, which Barakah put on by her
direction. Then they stole forth, the temptress
in high glee.</p>

<p>But they had not made ten steps in the hall
before two eunuchs pounced on them and stared
into their eyes. One beat the hag, whose screams
were frightful. The other, smiling, dragged back
Barakah, pushed her inside her room and locked
the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a>[Pg 58]</span></p>

<p>The meaning of the whole adventure remained
dark to her. Gulbeyzah, when informed of it,
declared that the old woman could not have been
employed by Yûsuf, who was much too honourable
and obedient to his father to indulge in such low
games. She ascribed the incident to machinations
of the lady Fitnah, beheld a plot to lure the
English girl to some lone place, there to be ravished
if not slain. Barakah laughed at such wild
fancies. That Yûsuf’s mother did not like her
much was plain to see; she had doubtless cherished
other projects for her first-born; but to impute
the thought of crime to her was too absurd.</p>

<p>“I bring good news,” Gulbeyzah said to change
the subject. “The Pasha has granted us the
visit to the bath with you. He has engaged the
best musicians and some famous dancers, and
all the maidens of good houses are to be invited
Oh, what joy!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>


<p>The party at the bath with all its ritual was one
of the ordeals which Muhammad Pasha had
wished to spare the English girl. As a man he
hated all the pranks that women play alone, and
deemed them of necessity immodest. But the
feeling roused in the harîm was too intense for
him; and as Barakah, he was told, herself desired
the entertainment, he could adduce no cogent
reason for refusal. The place in the haramlik
being ill adapted to a large assembly, he hired
the finest of the public baths for the occasion.
The dependants of the household clamouring
for a procession through the streets, he gave
them one, putting in place of Barakah a humbler
bride whose nuptials would be celebrated at his
cost.</p>

<p>About the first hour after noon, the bride of
Yûsuf left the house, sped by the ululations of
the whole harîm. In a carriage with the Pasha’s
nieces and Gulbeyzah, she was driven through
the streets to the Hammam. There, at the entrance,
stood two eunuchs, and in the antechamber
many women-servants of the Pash<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a>[Pg 60]</span>a’s
house. The ladies on arrival were conducted to
a second ante-room and there divested of all
clothing. Each put on a pair of clogs and had
her hair tied up in an embroidered kerchief.
While they were disrobing, other veiled ones
entered who laughed heartily at Barakah’s confusion.
The procession of the humbler bride had
arrived some minutes since, they were informed.</p>

<p>The elder of the Pasha’s nieces and Gulbeyzah
took each a hand of Barakah and led her on
from room to room, pausing in each to get accustomed
to the growing warmth. Suddenly they
came upon a noisy crowd. Two shiny negresses
sprang forth, and, singling out the bride, lifted her
up and bore her to a corner of the hall, beneath a
tap. They flung her on her back. Seeing a razor
flash, she uttered shriek on shriek the while they
fell to rubbing, making her joints crack, kneading
her very bones with their hard fingers. With eyes
half blind with soapsuds, she beheld a wreath of
naked figures moving round her in a kind of dance.
The wall and vaulted ceiling of the building
sweated. The windows were high up and gave no
light; there entered not a whiff of outer air. A
pulse beat at her temples. She felt suffocated.</p>

<p>At last the women stopped their rubbing, and
by playful slaps informed her that her turn was
ended. Like a sheep from the shearing she
rose up, staggering, intent to flee. But she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a>[Pg 61]</span>
caught again and made to sit down while her hair
was plaited. Then some one&mdash;it was Gulbeyzah&mdash;grasped
her hand and led her to the other end of
the great hall, where were two tanks of water
gently steaming. The hall presented a strange
spectacle, for it was full of naked figures, ebon and
mouse-brown, amber and snow-white. Singers,
all naked, sat beside one wall, and hummed and
droned and shrilled distractingly.</p>

<p>At a call, “The bride!” the whole crowd rushed
on Barakah with ululations. Her shame became
acute, an agony. Gulbeyzah led her up to one
of the tanks. Some one behind administered a
push, and she fell in; when some one else sprawled
in upon the top of her. Her head was under
water for some seconds. Spluttering, indignant,
her throat choked with sobs, she found herself
among a group of laughing girls, all colours, who
were ducking one another as they splashed about.
Gulbeyzah cried, “The butterflies! Look!
Look!” and pointed to the smooth stone marge,
where all the ripples in the light of smoky cressets
were reflected like a thousand fluttering moths.
The stir subsiding when all stopped to look, the
moths united into one great butterfly, dimly
perceived, whose wings beat faint and fainter as
the water stilled.</p>

<p>“She has eaten them all! Behold, how fat
she is!” cried out Gulbeyzah. “I believe she
is just going to have some others. Look!” She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a>[Pg 62]</span>
plunged, and made fresh ripples. Laughter hailed
this sally. A brown girl, lissom as a snake,
sprang hard on the facetious one and promptly
ducked her.</p>

<p>Angry, humiliated, feeling lost eternally, Barakah
scrambled out to face a row of grinning, dancing
hags. They and the shameless girls, the
fiendish music, the sweating walls, the fumes
of incense hiding the high roof, combined to make
her fancy she was underneath the earth assisting
at an orgy of malignant jinn.</p>

<p>Some one smote her from behind. She turned
round angrily. A fair-haired girl was running.
She ran after her. Another struck her lightly
as she ran. She turned again. A third sprang
on her, pinioned both her arms and kissed her
on the mouth, amid applause. Then first she
realized that it was all a game; the girls were
friendly. In the magnitude of her relief, her
shyness vanished. She soon led the romp. It
was one long dancing game of follow-my-leader,
varied with moods of hide-and-seek and leapfrog.
All the while the singers kept up their
wild din, the hired dancers never ceased their
weird contortions.</p>

<p>Afterwards, when they were all rubbed down
and clothed again, there was a feast of most
delicious dainties in the ante-rooms, and Barakah
was introduced to her late playfellows, transformed
as if by magic to polite young ladies. Every one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a>[Pg 63]</span>
of them, she found, had brought a present for
her. She chattered merrily in French, and ate
and drank with appetite unknown before. Driving
home in the carriage with three delicately perfumed
maidens, whose soft hands caressed her,
she experienced a blissful languor, like thanksgiving.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>


<p>Meanwhile the anguish of the lady Fitnah had
become unbearable. The beating she had received,
which kept her silent, was only part of the injustice
which prevailed against her. She alone, she had
assurance, was vouchsafed clear vision of the
horror of this marriage; all the rest were drugged
and blinded by the creature’s spells. She had
heard of Frankish women, who were barren, holding
men entranced for life, thus ending families; and
had no doubt at all but this was one of them. A
woman of volcanic passions, always righteous, for
her to look on evil was to seek to slay it.</p>

<p>She said, “The fiend will suck my Yûsuf’s life
out and then vanish.”</p>

<p>Her group of flatterers replied:</p>

<p>“Alas, yes! She will suck him as one sucks
an orange, and go her way refreshed,” giving the
sad mother a distracting picture of her first-born
as an empty orange-skin flung in the gutter among
other refuse.</p>

<p>She cried, “By Allah! she shall die!”</p>

<p>The sycophants replied, “Yes, by thy blessed
womb, she shall&mdash;an awful death,” and began to
meditate the form that death should take.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a>[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p>“But she has islamed,” one objected.</p>

<p>“Who knows if she has really islamed?” was
the answer. “Our lord the Pasha is bewitched.
He has forgone in her case every ordeal that might
test her faith. It is ascertained that she is barren
and will drink the bridegroom’s life. Woe! Woe!
The end of a most noble race!”</p>

<p>Inspired by hatred of iniquity, fanned and encouraged
by her little court, the anguished mother
had made sure arrangements for the English girl’s
dishonour, thinking no crime to vilify so bad a
thing. The scheme, alas! had been frustrated by
the eunuchs; whose vigilance redoubled the poor
lady’s grief. What dreadful magic must reside
in that foul creature to make the Pasha guard her
like a pearl? to make poor Yûsuf cling to her and
shun his mother? Her cronies recommended her
to summon negresses, of those who have familiar
intercourse with demons, and hold the mystic
ceremony called a zâr&mdash;the latest novelty. But
Fitnah Khânum feared the Pasha, who denounced
such consolations as against religion. She was in
despair. The hours flew by towards the wedding;
and she, perceiving all its horror, had no power to
stop it.</p>

<p>On the very morning of the day appointed for
the final ceremonies, she received two visitors, not
in her own room, but in a dirty closet used for
rubbish. The first to enter was the same old
woman who had lured Barakah from her chamber<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a>[Pg 66]</span>
with the name of Yûsuf. The second, throwing off
the veil, revealed a goatish face with pointed ears
beneath a foul white skull-cap. It was Abu
Sumûm, the most renowned of sorcerers.</p>

<p>He spread out his hands and chanted:</p>

<!--stanza--></div><!--poem--></div><!--poetry-container--></div>

<p>Having concluded this doggerel, setting forth
his stock-in-trade, the wizard stood with arms
crossed, grinning widely.</p>

<p>“I have an enemy,” faltered the lady, “and she
is dreadful, being a ginniyeh, and no child of Adam.”</p>

<p>“Think not to instruct me,” said the warlock.
“Nothing uncanny comes to Masr, but my hosts
of servants who are in the air inform me instantly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a>[Pg 67]</span>
Ah, if it is the Englishwoman thou opposest, have
a care, for she is full of art, having attained the
secret of invisibility, of self-protection, and also of
transforming people into dogs. Now, what, I ask,
dost thou require of me exactly&mdash;a potion that
shall make her love thee, or her madness, or a
wasting illness?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, nothing, save her instant death,”
sobbed Fitnah&mdash;“the wedding is to-day&mdash;and then
take all my wealth.”</p>

<p>“By thy leave, lady,” cried the wizard, much
offended, “I am not him thou seekest! Send
for an assassin! My business is with art and not
brutality. Find out some chopper-up of wood:
I am a carver!”</p>

<p>“But I know of no assassin! How can we
women find and bring one hither? O Abu Sumûm,
be generous, for Allah’s love!”</p>

<p>“Hear the excellent lady, the very mother of
kindness! Hear her, O Abu Sumûm! Behold her
sufferings! Grant her petition, for the love of
Allah, and our Lord reward thee!” pleaded the
old woman who had brought him in.</p>

<p>“I know not. It is not my line of business.
And yet, I bethink me, there is art in it,” muttered
the sorcerer, relenting visibly&mdash;“much art, for
she is the most skilful witch on earth; and no one
else in Masr, under Allah, could hope to overcome
her&mdash;Ha! What is this?” He raised his
hand to his right ear, and stood intently listening,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a>[Pg 68]</span>
as if to something just above him in the air. “I
thank thee, O Tarshûshak!&mdash;What is this?”
He turned to Fitnah with a mien of righteous
anger. “My servant tells me she has islamed.
Is that true? If so, why not inform me at the
first? My time is wasted. If she has islamed it is a
crime most heinous to assail her. May Allah&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Mercy! O my uncle, mercy!” Both the women
flung themselves upon the wizard, stopping his
mouth and dragging down his arm upraised to
curse them. “Wait but a moment! Only listen!
They say that she has islamed, being all bewitched.
She has not gone through all the ceremonies.
She refuses, and our lord the Pasha, by her spells,
supports her. Whether or no, she weds to-day my
first-born son, and she is barren and will keep him
from all other women. Thou shalt have much
wealth.”</p>

<p>Again the sorcerer went through the process of
relenting visibly. “Allah knows,” he groaned,
“it is a cruel task you set me. It will take three
days and nights of fasting and seclusion spent in
ceaseless study, to overcome her servants who are
in the air. Not until they are vanquished can
I mix the potion, for they would neutralize my
spells and make it harmless.”</p>

<p>“But the wedding is to-day!” wailed Fitnah,
out of patience.</p>

<p>“What matter, since her bale is of the lingering
sort, and not swift-slaying. Hear what I tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a>[Pg 69]</span>
thee! If I fight for thee with demons and obtain
the potion, use it not till three whole moons have
waxed and waned. Watch how thy son looks;
notice his behaviour! It may be she has islamed
in good faith.”</p>

<p>“All that thou wishest, only give the potion!”</p>

<p>“After three days thou shalt have it, by the
leave of Allah!”</p>

<p>The sorcerer then changed his tone for one of
caution, urging, “The reward, O blessed lady!
It is worth much money. And it is usual to give
something in advance by way of earnest.”</p>

<p>Fitnah untied a bundle which had lain beside
her all the while, and thrust it towards him. It
contained the best of all her jewels. Poor lady,
all her treasures&mdash;nay, her life itself&mdash;seemed
light to give to save her Yûsuf from that thirsty
ghoul. The wizard’s small eyes gloated on the
heap.</p>

<p>“Woe on thee, Abu Sumûm!” cried the old
woman. “Art thou not ashamed to take more
than is just from so benevolent and kind a lady?
Thy heart is of stone, not to be moved to bounty
by her pious tears.”</p>

<p>“Silence, woman!” With a dignified and
bounteous gesture, the sorcerer pushed back the
bag of trinkets, selecting for himself a single ring
containing stones of value. “Allah witness, that
I did but test the generosity of our good mistress.
But, being poor and with some dreadful work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a>[Pg 70]</span>
before me&mdash;having, moreover, risked my two old
ears in coming hither&mdash;I will, with thy permission,
O Most Excellent, accept this trifle. That and thy
gracious favour be my only payment!”</p>

<p>Uprising, he resumed again the woman’s headdress,
and in a woman’s piping voice enjoined, as he
prepared to go, “Forget not to delay three months.
A day too soon might cause tremendous evil.”</p>

<p>“Three months&mdash;I will remember!” answered
Fitnah dutifully; adding beneath her breath,
“Three days&mdash;too long! I think thou hast a mind
to fool me, O thou father of three months! Well,
bring thy potion. But first we will essay some
common poison without ceremony. Alas for Yûsuf
did we wait three months!”</p>

<p>She pressed both hands to her left side as if it
pained her.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>


<p>The Englishwoman had surrendered to the importunities
of all the household, and submitted
to be dressed entirely as an Eastern bride. Her
feet and hands had been well dyed with henna
overnight; her hair was intricately plaited, smeared
with ointment smelling strong of ambergris and
sprinkled with gold dust until it made a close and
shining covering; her lips and cheeks were painted,
and her eyes enlarged with kohl. Then came the
putting on of splendid clothes amid a din of chatter,
above which strains of music could be heard,
wafted by gusts from the selamlik, where festivity
had reigned for two days past. A jewelled crown
completing her apparel, she was led with joy-cries
to the great reception-room, and there enthroned
upon the dais. The room was fairly full of visitors
already, and every minute there were fresh arrivals.</p>

<p>Early that morning, Gulbeyzah had shown
Barakah her future lodging&mdash;five rooms within
the women’s portion of the house, but self-contained,
and with a private door to the selamlik. She had
beheld a salon hung with mirrors, full of gilded
chairs and tables; and then the nuptial chamber,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a>[Pg 72]</span>
the bed with silken bed-clothes, much too good to
use, beneath a canopy of cloth-of-gold embroidered.
Four monstrous candles placed around the bed
looked ceremonial, and the perfume of rare flowers
reminded her of English death-rooms.</p>

<p>The vision of that room oppressed her now as
she sat idle, feeling like a wooden image, and met
the criticizing stare of strangers who perfunctorily
blessed her. At first Gulbeyzah stayed with her
and played interpreter. Murjânah Khânum came
and kissed her, praying: “May the crown upon
thy brow inure thee to the burden of responsibility,
may the rich robes and the throne foreshadow
honour for thee; may the ordeal of long
stillness teach thee patience and long-suffering
with dignity. May all our blessings and our
prayers to-day secure thee fruitfulness, and mayst
thou live to see thy children’s children flourish
round thee. Our Lord preserve thee ever in His
grace. Amîn.”</p>

<p>Apart from this soft murmur of the Turkish
lady, she discerned no hint of a religious feeling
with regard to marriage. After an hour Gulbeyzah
mingled with the throng of visitors, and Barakah
was left alone to face the curiosity, the unknown
talk about her. Every one of all those women
used strong scent, and the smoke of divers kinds
of incense dimmed the air. The bride herself
was saturated with perfumery; which, however,
could not drown the odour of her own new garments.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a>[Pg 73]</span>
This grew sickening. Her brain swam. She was
stuck there like a painted doll to be appraised,
inspected.</p>

<p>Anon the crowd was drawn away from her.
She sat unnoticed. A group of female musicians
had arrived, with them a well-known singer.
There ensued a frightful caterwauling, as it seemed
to Barakah, but the rest were charmed, to judge
from their enraptured “Ah’s!” and ravished
gestures.</p>

<p>Then a brown girl, clad diaphanously, writhed
a dance of lewd suggestion, ogling the bride the
while maliciously. Her performance was applauded
even by Murjânah Khânum. Gulbeyzah
flew up to the bride and whispered: “We are in
great luck! Tâhir, the greatest singer in the
world, has been performing for the bridegroom’s
friends in the selamlik. He is coming here to
sing to us, behind that screen. Look! Those
are his children.” A small boy and girl had stolen
shyly in, and were made much of, being passed
from hand to hand. Gulbeyzah ran off to convey
the news to other rooms.</p>

<p>Another minute and dead silence fell. All
watched the screen. Up leapt an eerie note,
sustained till it became a terror to the ear, when all
at once it broke into a shower of trills like impish
laughter. This was repeated thrice, and then the
singer struck a solemn and majestic measure&mdash;a
religious strain, which his strange voice embroidered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a>[Pg 74]</span>
with all human passions in their natural tones.
Barakah forgot her weariness. This singing was
like nothing she had ever heard. It seemed to
dignify all life with a tremendous meaning. All
unawares she joined the gusty sigh which swept
the whole assembly when the last note died.
There followed a quick panting melody of lover’s
sighs, more like a bird’s song than the effort of a
human voice; then came a wail of more than
human anguish, and then the singing ceased quite
unexpectedly. There was a storm of moans and
prayers for more, but Tâhir, the great singer, had
already gone.</p>

<p>Barakah became once more aware of stiffness,
headache, and a burning mouth. She called to
Hamdi, Yûsuf’s little brother, one of her former
pupils, to bring water to her. He ran off at once,
but brought, instead of water, cloying sherbet
which increased her thirst. Her eyelids were so
stiffened they would hardly close; her eyeballs
ached; the stiffness of the paint upon her cheeks
became an iron mask. She felt pilloried, derided,
miserably alone, when lo! a small soft hand
touched hers confidingly. It was the singer’s
little daughter, who, grown tired of sweets and
petting, had come to the one lonely person in the
room, the quiet place. She looked up in the face
of Barakah and smiled. Her brother, a still
smaller child, had followed her. They both sat
down without the slightest ceremony, and with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a>[Pg 75]</span>
their heads against her knees, their hands in hers,
fell fast asleep. This little group, when it was
noticed, caused much laughter and a shout:
“Mabrûkah!” (lucky). The bride, a statue of
endurance, paid no heed.</p>

<p>At last a great noise came from the selamlik.
A eunuch rushed to say that the procession of the
bridegroom to the mosque had just returned. At
once, a heavy veil, precluding sight, was flung
on Barakah. The bride’s train formed. With
tapers and with garlands, amid joy-cries, she was
led to her own gilded salon, and there left alone.
In the same instant, so it seemed to her, the
bridegroom came. Her veil was lifted. She felt
like to die. She dared not raise her eyes for fear
of weeping. The ritual words she had been
schooled to say escaped her memory. But, as
luck befell, they were unneeded.</p>

<p>“Grand Dieu!” cried Yûsuf Bey. “The
fools&mdash;the miscreants have made you look like one
of them. Your face&mdash;your hair! Ah, mon amour!
Ma colombe!”</p>

<p>She was obliged to laugh, and the nice-looking,
eager youth laughed with her. Fatigue and
headache fell off from her like a garment.</p>

<p>On the next afternoon, when Barakah, at peace
with all the world, was sitting in her gilded parlour,
on the cushioned window-sill, peeping through
the lattice at red masts and flags, the decorations
for her wedding not yet taken down, it happened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a>[Pg 76]</span>
that she called for water. That cry resounded
through the whole haramlik in the hours of heat,
and slaves with pitchers waited always ready to
obey it. The girl who answered brought a vase
of amber fluid, which she proclaimed the most
delicious sherbet known to woman. The lady
Fitnah had herself prepared it for the bride’s
delight. Barakah took one sip, disliked the taste,
and, only waiting for politeness till the maid had
gone, poured out the rest upon a plant of jasmine
in a flower-pot which stood upon a shelf within the
lattice. A little later she was very sick, and went
and lay down on her bed. She was feeling better
when her husband was announced.</p>

<p>“Yûsuf!” she cried, as he came in, “it is so
curious. Madame your mother sent me up some
special sherbet. I tasted it, and found it disagreeable,
so I emptied all the rest upon the plant
there. Then I felt so ill&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>She got no further. Yûsuf, following the direction
of her gesture, had fixed his eyes upon the
flower-pot. They were riveted. The plant was
dead, a shrivelled, blackened object. With one
despairing cry he clutched his forehead and
rushed headlong from the room.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>


<p>“O wretched day! O death of honour! O
calamity! Didst thou not swear to guard my love
from danger, O my father? Yet death has
reached her&mdash;poison! This house is now gehennum.
Woe to all of us! O Allah, ease the sorrow
of my heart! O Lord, behold me rent in twain&mdash;My
wife! My mother!”</p>

<p>Yûsuf had burst into the room of the selamlik
where his father was transacting business with
the steward of his property. Regardless of the
stranger’s presence, he gave way to grief and rage,
falling prostrate on the pavement, tearing at it
with his hands, and biting at it with his teeth
convulsively. The steward, a person of discretion,
rose at once and asked permission to retire. The
Pasha nodded, and, when he was gone, bent over
his demented child, inquiring of his cause of grief
with heart near broken, for he feared the worst
had happened. By dint of patience he elicited
the simple facts, which, when he knew them,
eased his mind so greatly that he smiled and
rendered fervent thanks to the Most High. The
Englishwoman was not dead; the poisonous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a>[Pg 78]</span>
attempt had failed; the vision of an angry Consul,
void of decency, transgressing with investigations
every man’s intrinsic right to sole and secret
jurisdiction in his own harîm, raising a scandal far
more dreadful than the sad event, receded suddenly.</p>

<p>“Be not distressed, my son!” he urged benignly.
“Praise God, as I do, that the matter is
no worse. Think! a mere plant of jasmine dead
in place of her thou lovest. The call is for rejoicing,
not for grief. Have patience, O my soul!
Control thy spirits!”</p>

<p>“Have patience, sayest thou?” sobbed Yûsuf.
“My anguish is more terrible than flesh can bear.
My mother, she who bore me, whom I love by
nature, has turned my enemy, to poison her by
whom alone I live. I hate the murderess of my
delight, and would destroy her; but lo! she is
my mother, and I can but weep. My soul is torn
asunder. All the world is blackened. O Allah,
take my life! O Lord, protect me!”</p>

<p>Muhammad Pasha was profoundly moved by
this lament. He thanked God for vouchsafing
him a son who, in the moment of extreme affliction,
could still preserve such justice in his sentiments.</p>

<p>“Take comfort, O my son! Be thankful that
no harm has happened,” he insisted tenderly.</p>

<p>But Yûsuf would not be consoled. The soothing
tone enraged him, seeming to make a trifle of his
agony. He leapt upon his feet and cried:</p>

<p>“No harm! O Allah! Is it nought then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a>[Pg 79]</span>
what I tell thee? Then thou hast no love for me.
Thou art my father; thou didst promise to preserve
her from my mother’s malice. Thou seest
my despair, and yet thou smilest. O Allah, kill
me now, for I am orphaned cruelly. Both my
parents hate me, and deride my sufferings. I go
to my mother Murjânah, who is kind and gracious.
She will weep with me.”</p>

<p>And before the older man could grasp his purpose,
much less intervene, that victim of a duteous
heart had fled the room. After a space of thought
the Pasha followed to Murjânah Khânum’s quarters,
where he found the young man writhing on a bed
of cushions, while his second mother wept with him
and prayed.</p>

<p>“Listen, O Yûsuf, O my son!” began the
father earnestly. “I have been thinking. Thou
and thy bride shall have a house apart&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>But at his voice the young man, foaming at the
mouth, sprang up from his couch with teeth and
hands clenched in a final spasm, and, flinging up
his hands, fell back insensible.</p>

<p>“Go, fetch the leech, the fit will pass, in sh´Allah.
Be secret, lest tongues wag to our dishonour,”
said Murjânah, and the Pasha went at once to the
selamlik, returning with a black slave skilled in
surgery. Yûsuf was bled. While assisting in the
operation the Pasha asked Murjânah:</p>

<p>“What punishment is meet for her we wot of?”</p>

<p>“Forgiveness, for the love of Allah!” was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a>[Pg 80]</span>
answer. “Upbraid her on religious grounds and
then forgive her. We know her generous, impulsive
nature. Thy sudden kindness will affect her more
than blows. Poor soul, she must have suffered
very deeply. My slaves inform me that she saw
this Englishwoman as a kind of ghoul. Tomorrow,
with her nature, she may wish to hug her.
Remove the young folks for the present.”</p>

<p>“I had thought of that,” rejoined the Pasha.
“By Allah, they shall have the garden-house
towards Rôdah. To-morrow I will have the place
prepared for them.”</p>

<p>When Yûsuf Bey came back to life he wept
anew, but weakly, helplessly. In that condition
he was carried to his own apartments by the
surgeon, with the Pasha’s help, Murjânah going on
before to warn the bride.</p>

<p>This sad procession happened to encounter a
slave of Leylah Khânum’s who, hearing Yûsuf’s
groans, ran off with screams and told her mistress
he was dead. At once the whole harîm was filled
with wailing. Fitnah Khânum, thunderstruck
by the appalling news, defiled her face with dirt
and tore her raiment. She rushed shrieking to
the bridal chamber, as did every woman and child
who by relationship could claim the right to enter.
She knelt before the bride, who stood apart,
bewildered, and besought her:</p>

<p>“Remove the spell, restore him, for the love of
Allah. I sinned. I here confess it. Thou art<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a>[Pg 81]</span>
much too strong for me. Thou, by thy magic,
hast turned round the sword to pierce my bosom.
I was impatient, I am justly punished. The
wisest of mankind advised me I should wait three
months. Thou seest how I love thee, how I kneel
to thee and kiss thy feet. Accept my life’s
devotion: only save him!”</p>

<p>Without seeking for an answer to her prayer,
she rose distractedly and went and flung herself
upon the bed where Yûsuf lay. He moaned:</p>

<p>“My mother! Oh, alas, thy bitterness! How
couldst thou seek to rob me of delight? Behold
me dead! Now art thou satisfied? O Lord
have mercy on me! O Calamity!”</p>

<p>Blubbering loudly, she implored forgiveness.
Soon his arms went round her; they lay, hugging
one another, sobbing, cooing, while the spectators
wept aloud in tender sympathy. The Pasha’s face
was hidden in his pocket-handkerchief. Murjânah
Khânum murmured prayers beneath her breath.</p>

<p>“O my despair! my wickedness!” the mother
shrieked.</p>

<p>“My grief, my desolation; now my joy!”
sobbed Yûsuf.</p>

<p>“O Lord, relieve me, for my heart is bursting,”
moaned the Pasha.</p>

<p>“Oh, what do I behold. How rapture pains
me!” came from bystanders. All, in the selfish orgy
of emotion, forgot the terrified and wondering bride,
who, understanding not a word of what was said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a>[Pg 82]</span>
surveyed a riddle. She asked the Pasha what the
matter was. He answered with a hiccup of emotion:</p>

<p>“It is nothing, mademoiselle. It will soon pass.
Have no fear!” which only added to her stupefaction.</p>

<p>She had seen such exhibitions in ill-governed
nurseries, but never among grown-up folks before.
To account for all the outcry she imagined some
tremendous tragedy, and waited anxiously to
learn its nature.</p>

<p>It was close on midnight ere the chamber
emptied and, left alone with Yûsuf, she could put
her question. Then he told her the whole story
with frequent interjection of “Oh, how I suffered!”
She learnt that she had narrowly escaped a cruel
death. But how her danger bore upon the scenes
she had just witnessed, or in what manner they
were meant to reassure her, she could not divine.
Yûsuf himself bestowed no thought on her predicament,
immersed in contemplation of his own
emotions. Feeling alone and outcast, she wept a
little ere she went to sleep.</p>

<p>In the morning Yûsuf had recovered his accustomed
spirits. When she alluded with a shudder
to his mother’s wickedness, he bade her have no fear;
all that was past. From that day forth his mother
would be sure to cherish her. Her mind derived no
comfort from that light assurance; it remained
perturbed until the Pasha came with tidings of a new
arrangement he had made for her and Yûsuf to
sojourn in a pleasure-house of his among the suburbs.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<!--chap--></div>
<div class="chap">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a>[Pg 83]</span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>


<p>The pleasure-house was a two-storeyed building,
much dilapidated, having been unoccupied by
the proprietor for many years. The garden,
originally made for pleasure by the Pasha’s father,
had since been used exclusively for growing
vegetables. It was now like several fields with
palm trees set at intervals, the whole surrounded
by a high mud wall. The Pasha in one day had had
the rooms cleaned out, the snakes extracted from
their walls by a professional charmer; the next
he sent down servants with the furniture, and the
same evening Barakah arrived.</p>

<p>The house resembled a gigantic lantern in the
blue of night with light exuding from its many
lattices. Descending from the harîm carriage
which had brought her, together with two women
and the girl Fatûmah, her own slaves, she was
met by Yûsuf, whom she had not seen all day. He
introduced to her two men&mdash;a new experience,
which seemed an earnest of less strict seclusion.
One, who bore a torch, bowed low with eyes
downcast. He was the gardener. The other&mdash;a
most honest-looking youth&mdash;gazed awestruck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a>[Pg 84]</span>
at her shrouded form, his large brown eyes dilated
to the very utmost, while a vast ecstatic smile bared
all his teeth&mdash;a smile which told of infinite fidelity.</p>

<p>“His name,” said Yûsuf, “is Ghandûr&mdash;my
faithful friend. He is your water-carrier, and
will be always within call in case you have some
errand out of doors.”</p>

<p>Yûsuf then walked apart with the two men,
while Sawwâb, the eunuch, showed the lady her
apartments. Sawwâb had come as escort to the
carriage and returned with it as soon as he had
seen her settled comfortably. A leering crone
was left to guard propriety, a task which she performed
extremely ill on that first evening; for
instead of checking the high spirits of the slave-girls,
who romped for joy at their release from
stricter discipline, she smiled upon their antics,
and herself performed a most improper dance
before the bride.</p>

<p>For several days Yûsuf remained contented in
the house and garden; while Barakah, half-dazed
but happy too, beheld him as incarnate passion,
not as man. She was the first to tire of loves and
doves, and try to talk of something sensible.
Yûsuf appeared to think the speech of every day
a waste of time between them.</p>

<p>Then came the period of tiffs, the fretful wakening.
Yûsuf began to deal in sentiment about his
mother, proclaiming it a hardship that his wife
should still distrust her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a>[Pg 85]</span></p>

<p>“She is kind and tender&mdash;O, how dear to me!
Go to her, Barakah! Kneel at her feet, embrace
her hands, and she will surely pardon.”</p>

<p>“Pardon? What, pray?” exclaimed the bride
indignantly. “It is for her to ask pardon of me
whom, kindly recollect, she tried to poison.”</p>

<p>“She is older than you; she is my mother. It
behoves you to be modest and submissive towards
her. I have forgiven all, and so should you. She
is my mother.”</p>

<p>It was a relief one morning when the Pasha came
and bore the young man off, declaring jokingly
that he would die of too much sweet if he remained
immured there longer. Of Barakah he
said the same, informing her that Leylah Khânum
and Gulbeyzah would call that afternoon to take
her out upon a round of visits.</p>

<p>Then Yûsuf took to being absent all day long,
but came home gladly in the evenings, full of love.
He volunteered no tidings of his day’s amusements,
and when she questioned him about them seemed
to think it odd.</p>

<p>“All that is not your business,” he informed her
kindly.</p>

<p>She hinted at the pleasures of companionship,
the bond of common interests. He laughed, inquiring:</p>

<p>“Are we not companions? Have we not interests
in common? You teach me English, and
I teach you Arabic; we compare the customs of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a>[Pg 86]</span>
the races. And we love! Are not these interests
much greater than to hear what Fulân said to
Zeyd, what Zeyd replied, and whether Hâfiz or
Mahmûd obtained the Government appointment?
That is the life of men, a passing of the hours till
night, when they return to the beloved. If anything
of weight befell I should inform you. What
pleasure could it give to you to hear repeated the
gabble of a lot of people you will never know?”</p>

<p>Perceiving much in Yûsuf’s tastes and conversation
which pious English people would have thought
ungodly, she gasped a little on discovering he was
religious. Attracted by a faith which showed
some tolerance of human failings, she was studying
the rudiments of El Islâm by Yûsuf’s guidance;
acquiring prayers and all the rules for saying them,
including washings and the proper time and place.
Nothing seemed left to the believer’s judgment,
it was all laid down. When, at a lesson in prostration,
she was moved to laughter, he became quite
terrible, and warned her threateningly that in
this country any man or woman was likely to
be torn in pieces for a hint of blasphemy. The
awe she felt was oddly mixed with fascination.</p>

<p>There were details she would not have chosen
in her cloistered life, but on the whole it was the
happiest that she had ever known. She was waited
on hand and foot who had known drudgery; her
husband used her as a reigning beauty who, but a
few weeks since, had been esteemed uninteresting.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a>[Pg 87]</span>
Then there were pleasures of society. The Pasha’s
carriage often came, with one or other of the ladies
and Gulbeyzah, to take her round to call on grand
harîms. She was received with favour by great
ladies. One, a princess, by name Amînah Khânum,
insisted on her spending a whole day alone with her.</p>

<p>This dame, though elderly, still dressed to charm.
Her rooms were full of European furniture, but she
herself sat always on a sofa, smoking a long, old-fashioned
pipe with coral mouthpiece.</p>

<p>“You are not of the first rank in your own
country,” she told Barakah to start with, bluntly;
“or you would not be where you are. You do not
know the people I have met in France and England,
so don’t pretend you do. I value frankness.”
It seemed she knew the English pretty thoroughly.</p>

<p>She spoke good French and talked of Western
Europe with intelligence, seeming in general to
approve its customs. One little speech of hers
amazed the visitor, intruding as it did abruptly
upon lighter talk:</p>

<p>“The Europeans have degraded love and made
life banal. They spread life’s agitation over a vast
surface and account it progress; we value depth
and stillness. Enlarging each life’s pool, they make
it shallow. A woman’s life is of the feelings which
are dulled, not quickened, by extensive interests.
Their men too suffer, growing superficial, flippant,
without depth of character.”</p>

<p>When Barakah retailed this saying to Gulbeyzah,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a>[Pg 88]</span>
the Circassian sighed: “She knows!” and told a
curious story.</p>

<p>It was that years ago a European officer in the
Egyptian service had wooed Amînah Khânum
secretly; and she had been entirely captivated by
his charms. But endeavouring to sound his character,
she found him shallow. She made him islam,
but his carelessness informed her that conversion
meant no more for him than access to her. In the
same way she perceived that what he felt for her
was nothing more profound than the desire to add
a Muslim lady to his list of conquests. The blow
was dire, for she was then extremely lovely, and a
great examiner of men, having divorced or killed
ten husbands. She would not have him tell a
tale among his kind, yet could not conquer her
intense desire of him. What could she do? She
satisfied her heart, and the next morning gave him
death in easy form, being well versed in poisons.</p>

<p>Barakah cried out in horror; but Gulbeyzah
shrugged.</p>

<p>“What else could woman, not a harlot, do?
He was an infidel, and would have bragged of her.
Ever since then Amînah Khânum has a kindness
for the Franks, though she deplores their levity.”</p>

<p>“And would you do the same?”</p>

<p>“One cannot tell beforehand. I am not a
princess. Either that or kill myself. May God
preserve us from unsanctioned love of all kinds!”</p>

<p>Barakah felt overwhelmed by the intenseness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a>[Pg 89]</span>
the tragic vigour of these women, who seemed mild
and playful.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cameron called at the garden-house one
afternoon, and Barakah was proud to give her a real
English tea. Except for the costume, which was
much richer, and an added glow of happiness, the
visitor, she felt convinced, could not detect the
slightest change in her. One thing at least was
certain, she had not deteriorated, as Mrs. Cameron
before the marriage had foretold she would. The
visitor was amiable, and made no allusion to the
past. Before departing she made Barakah an
offer of some knitting wool and needles she had
just received from England. The wife of Yûsuf
Bey accepted gladly, for she began to feel the
weight of idle hands.</p>

<p>The wools arriving an hour later, she debated
what to make with them; and, being at the time
in English mood, decided on a pair of slippers for
her husband. But when she told him of her purpose,
he frowned wonderingly, and asked:</p>

<p>“Are you a shoemaker?”</p>

<p>Utterly disconcerted by so apt a question, she
tried to paint the beauty of the project, but he
could not see it.</p>

<p>“If you want slippers, buy them in the market.
It is not your trade. When one like you employs
the needle, it is not for use. Ask my mother; she
will show you the right work to do.”</p>

<p>He had his own ideas. The coloured wools were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a>[Pg 90]</span>
given to Fatûmah, who made anklets of them, and
other personal adornments, which amused her for a
week.</p>

<p>Deducing from her wish to make him slippers
that she found the hours long in his absence, Yûsuf
procured her books in French and English. He
also brought her a fine musical box, which played
dance-music in stentorian tones to the rapture of
the slaves, who kept it going all day long. The
Pasha came and begged her not to imagine that
she was debarred from every pleasure. It would
be cruel to confine a damsel of her breeding as
strictly as a native of the country. Let her but
name her wishes; they should be deferred to. He
even threw out hints that she and Yûsuf might
possibly see Paris in the coming summer.</p>

<p>Thus exhorted, and encouraged by the sight of
women like Amînah Khânum, who seemed to order
every one their way, she forsook the timid attitude
which had been hers since marriage, and viewed
existence with commanding eyes. The old woman
who had been engaged to play propriety, was horrified
one day to see her talking barefaced at a
window to Ghandûr, the water-carrier. The crone
expostulated, coaxed, entreated, and at length,
when all proved vain, informed the husband, who,
to her utter consternation, laughed.</p>

<p>“Ghandûr?” he cried; “Ghandûr is my right
foot,” and immediately applied that member to
the beldame’s person.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a>[Pg 91]</span></p>

<p>The old woman did not dare to speak again to
Barakah, though the latter plagued her mercilessly,
crying “Ghandûr!” here and “Ghandûr!” there,
for the treat of seeing her curvet and wring her
hands.</p>

<p>One morning, after Yûsuf had departed, she grew
conscious of a great oppression due to lack of outlet.
The feeling had been with her vaguely for some
days. Now she knew it for a craving; she must
see an English person to revive her fading interest
in the strange things around her.</p>

<p>“Ghandûr!” she cried.&mdash;He answered “Hâdir!”&mdash;“Fetch
me a carriage for the fifth hour after
noon.”</p>

<p>“Hâdir!” he said again; and from her lattice
she saw him speed off on his errand like the wind.
There were few carriages for hire in Cairo in those
days, and it was necessary to bespeak one early.</p>

<p>“The lady wishes to go out? Shall I accompany
her?” cooed the old woman, who was hovering near.</p>

<p>“No. I go alone!”</p>

<p>“I had better accompany the lady.”</p>

<p>“No, I tell thee!”</p>

<p>The lady stamped her foot, when the duenna
shuffled off, wagging her head forebodingly and
mumbling.</p>

<p>“How absurd!” thought Barakah. “Haven’t
Yûsuf and the Pasha told me twenty times that
women, in the kind of shroud they make us wear,
can go anywhere alone without attracting notice?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a>[Pg 92]</span></p>

<p>When the carriage came&mdash;a hooded one&mdash;she
sallied forth, correctly veiled, escorted by Ghandûr,
who, seeing no one with her, asked leave to mount
the box beside the driver. She gave it, feeling
sure that the old woman was watching the departure
through some upper lattice. Ghandûr sprang up
with a delighted grin, quite rigid with the pride of
high preferment.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>


<p>In the sandy lane outside the Camerons’ garden-gate
some carriages already waited; a saddle-horse
or two and many donkeys, all in charge of
servants, twitched their ears and swished their
tails in the deep shadow by the wall. Barakah
felt disappointed and annoyed. It seemed that she
had lighted on a great reception, when her desire
had been a quiet chat with Mrs. Cameron. Prevision
of Ghandûr’s amazement if she gave the
order to turn back, and the satisfaction which her
quick return would give the mother of propriety,
made her go on; but she determined to stay only
a few minutes and then walk home, the evening
being cool, to spend the time. With this in view,
upon alighting she gave money to Ghandûr, bidding
him dismiss the carriage and himself go home.
He made a good deal of remonstrance, but at
last submitted, understanding that the people of
the house would furnish means of transit. He
considered it his place, however, to remain in
waiting.</p>

<p>Barakah then went in, much hampered by the
stare of squatting servants which seemed to cling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a>[Pg 94]</span>
like fetters to her ankles. A Berberi butler ushered
her into the drawing-room and announced her with
the single word:</p>

<p>“Harîm.”</p>

<p>The room was even fuller than she had expected.
Her entrance seemed to cause a great sensation.
Her heart sank, there was singing in her ears; she
encountered all those faces with a sense of drowning.
Moving mechanically in a trance of apprehension,
it was with surprise a minute later that she found
herself ensconced in a deck-chair beside an open
window, alive and quite uninjured, though her pulse
beat high. She removed her mouth-veil then and
looked about her. It seemed to be a gathering of
the whole English colony, with the addition of some
French and German ladies. The Consul, her aversion,
was talking with some other men, who formed
a standing group. He took no notice of her, rather
pointedly. The women, thirty at the least, kept
up a din of chatter.</p>

<p>The hostess came and introduced her to the ladies
near her. Though the manner in which this was
done was very kind, Barakah felt that Mrs. Cameron
disliked her coming. That lady looked upon her as
a fallen creature, to be visited and seen occasionally
out of charity, no longer to be classed with
English women. The prejudice stung Barakah
to downright impudence. Abashment left her.
She began to chatter and laugh loudly just to let
her hostess know that she was somebody. Sipping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a>[Pg 95]</span>
her tea, she talked of harîm life, deriding the false
notions which prevailed concerning it. It was
perfectly delightful, not a bit what Europeans
thought. She proceeded to retail her own experiences.
In a trice she gathered half a score of eager
listeners.</p>

<p>But is not this or that the case invariably?
they inquired. She was able to confute them always,
with amusing instances. She sank her voice,
the listening heads drew nearer; there were stifled
giggles. Certain stories she had picked up from
Gulbeyzah were quite killing. She told of the old
woman who was set to guard her&mdash;“an Oriental
Mrs. Grundy,” she assured them&mdash;and her horror
at her going out alone that afternoon.</p>

<p>“But my husband doesn’t mind a bit, of course.
The dear man lets me do just what I like. It is
only middle-class people nowadays who are strict
about seclusion.... Oh, by the way, do you know
Princess Amînah?...”</p>

<p>She had never in her life talked so effectively.
The stored frivolity of weeks was spent in one short
hour; while with the tail of an eye she noted Mrs.
Cameron’s disgust at her small social triumph, the
shrugs and glances she exchanged with her own
kind.</p>

<p>While her success was at its height, she readjusted
her white muslin mouth-veil and got up
to go.</p>

<p>“Thank you for a most delightful hour,” she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a>[Pg 96]</span>
gushed at taking leave, receiving in reply a look
which plainly said: “You have deteriorated.”</p>

<p>Going out upon the wave of her excitement, she
suddenly remembered that she had dismissed her
carriage. It was no matter. The distance to be
traversed was no more than half a mile, the road a
straight one, shady at that hour. The little walk
would serve to cool her wits.</p>

<p>But Ghandûr, who was squatting by the outer
door, sprang up at sight of her. He bade her
“Wait!” with a profusion of engaging grins and
frantic gestures. Taking her assent for granted,
when she stopped to argue, he set off down the lane
at a great pace, trailing a plume of dust from either
heel.</p>

<p>Seeing she still moved on, despite her servant’s
warning, the doorkeeper of the house stepped forward
and, saluting, begged her to return indoors.
When she refused, he shrugged despairingly and
with some word which sounded like an oath went
back to his own seat. The waiting grooms and
donkey-boys called out, and standing together in a
little crowd stared after her. She thought them
merely rude.</p>

<p>She moved against the stream of country people
returning homeward from their business in the city.
They stared at her in passing, and occasionally
made remarks which sounded friendly. The dust
raised by the trail of robes, and by the donkeys’
hoofs, was some annoyance; but the dust itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a>[Pg 97]</span>
became a splendour where the sunset caught it;
the shadows were deep blue, enhancing colours of
the crowd; and the balm of evening was in every
breath she drew. To Barakah, who had not walked
for months, the very motion was a comfort. She
stepped forward briskly, musing on the scene she
had just quitted.</p>

<p>What were those women saying of her now? Mrs.
Cameron was no doubt declaiming, and they all
agreed with her. Every word that she had said
was turned against her. On that perception she
was filled with shame. The unkindness, the indecency
of holding up her husband’s people to provide
amusement for a hostile race appeared unthinkable,
the basest treachery. A wave of tenderness
for Yûsuf, for Ghandûr, the slave-girls, even
the old woman,&mdash;all the home surroundings,&mdash;overcame
her; while her mind abhorred the frigid,
callous English, who had lured her on to make a
mock of her. Why should she ever see them more?
She hated them. Phrases which had passed her
lips ten minutes since were now abominable&mdash;a
source of shame that could not cease, it seemed, but
must flow on for ever till the end of time. How had
she uttered them? It was their fault for scorning
her, for placing her on an unnatural footing, making
speech a pitfall. The harîm was her natural refuge,
her true home. She never wished to quit its shade
again.</p>

<p>Thus fiercely musing, she pursued the sandy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a>[Pg 98]</span>
lane until she reached a point where a road
branched off from it at right angles.</p>

<p>Upon the corner stood a whitewashed shrine,
pink in the glow of sunset, the crescent flashing
on its egg-like dome; beside it a great tree under
whose foliage a crowd of men were sitting out on
stools, smoking and drinking coffee in the shade.
Some of these took notice of her, pointing rudely,
attracting the attention of the others and the
passers-by. Supposing something wrong with her
attire, she quickened step. Her road ran through
a village. She heard shouts and laughter. A
well-dressed man strode past her from behind, and
turning searched her eyes. Spurred now by fear,
she tried to hurry on; but found herself the centre
of a crowd, whose members, moving with her,
jabbered, pointed, jeered. One tweaked her
habbarah; another seized her arm as if to feel
the muscle. Her heart beat loud, her throat was
choked with sobs repressed by terror.</p>

<p>The mob grew every moment bolder in its menace.
A stalwart peasant-woman barred the way
before her, grinning&mdash;prepared, it seemed, to pluck
away her mouth-veil.</p>

<p>Barakah had paused, cowering, not knowing
where to turn for succour, when the shout of a
familiar voice relieved the strain and let her tears
have vent. Ghandûr came on the scene, leading
a saddled ass. His explanations soon dispersed
the mob. He lifted her upon the donkey; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a>[Pg 99]</span>
in a moment, as things happen in a dream, she
was at home again, confronting Yûsuf, who approached
the gate as they arrived.</p>

<p>He seemed thunderstruck at her appearance.
Hearing Ghandûr’s story, he asked God for help,
and raised his arm to strike her. She fell fainting
at his feet.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<!--chap--></div>
<div class="chap">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a>[Pg 100]</span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>


<p>When Barakah came to herself, she was lying in
her bedroom, which was dim and seemed unusually
lofty, for her bed was on the floor, and a feeble
lamp confined in perforated brass, which gave what
light there was, stood down beside it. The pattern
of the brass-work, much enlarged, was faintly
reproduced on wall and ceiling. She was alone,
but from a distance sounds of wailing reached her,
and she heard her husband cursing the old woman
for neglect of duty.</p>

<p>When she recalled her glee at setting forth that
afternoon, the course of subsequent events seemed
very cruel. After such misfortunes, consolation
was her due; instead of which the house was in
commotion, Yûsuf mad. Self-pity overwhelmed
her. She was all alone among strange savage
beings without sympathy; while those who
might have understood and shared her feelings
were her enemies. She lay with face down on her
pillow, weeping silently.</p>

<p>By and by Yûsuf came into the room. She could
tell by his hard breathing he was still enraged.
Afraid that he was going to beat her, she lay quiet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a>[Pg 101]</span>
as though still unconscious; but in a little while
a sob betrayed her. Then his wrath descended.
French deserting him, he raved at her in Arabic and
Turkish; and her inability to catch his meaning
made him angrier. She lay in terror, crying
bitterly, replying to such questions as she understood,
until his fury sank to lamentation and
his French returned.</p>

<p>“My honour!” was his cry. “You have
betrayed my honour in thus going forth alone.
The servants of the English house who know you
will send a whisper and a laugh through all the
markets. And those who saw you walking in the
dust!... Have you no shame, no delicacy?
What will my father say? The news will kill
him! You have killed my father!”</p>

<p>“You do not think of me at all,” sobbed Barakah.
“Here have I been insulted, scared to death by
your vile people, and you scold me! I wish that
I had never seen you. I am so unhappy! In
England people would be punished for the things
you do. Those horrible men and women who
attacked me&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“May Allah burn them, every one!” cried
Yûsuf in fierce Arabic. “Gladly would I pluck
out all their tongues! They witnessed the dishonour
of my name, and will relate it.”</p>

<p>The wrangle lasted far into the night. At last,
however, Yûsuf’s tone relented; they embraced,
and he demanded the whole history of her ill-starred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a>[Pg 102]</span>
visit. But when he heard that men had been in
the same room with her, his wrath redoubled. He
beat his breast, he gnashed his teeth, he slapped
her face, he paced the room denouncing her depravity.</p>

<p>“You are a brute!” she cried hysterically.
“What harm if men were present? They did not
come near me. I am not like your women&mdash;bred
up to think of one thing only. Nor are Englishmen
like you; they have respect for women. You
are mad.”</p>

<p>Yûsuf was really mad, or seemed so, at that
moment. He called her evil names in every tongue
of which he had a smattering; and then in French,
made childish by his rage, accused all Europeans
of disgusting conduct.</p>

<p>“You deny it&mdash;<i>hein</i>? You are a liar, for the fact
is known. We are not ignorant; we travel, and
we have their books. What say you of their balls,
their public dances, where women&mdash;nay, young
virgins&mdash;choose what man they please, deserting
husband or fiancé&mdash;empty names!&mdash;and dance and
afterwards retire with him? The fact is known!
The race is shameless&mdash;may God punish them!
It is forbidden for us to cast up former things in
marriage; but for the future I command you to
forsake their filthiness. Go once again, and we
shall know you worthless! Swear to renounce
their company, or I will kill you!”</p>

<p>She sat up and confronted him with eyes of fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a>[Pg 103]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, brute!” she panted; “monster! rabid
dog! I have had enough of you and your
behaviour. I shall leave you. To-morrow I shall
go to the Consul and tell him how you struck me!”</p>

<p>“You shall not leave this room. I am your
master.”</p>

<p>“Lock the door, block up the window, bind me,
guard me, I still will find some way to let the
Consul know. You shall be punished&mdash;I have
sworn it. I have had enough, I say. I shall
return to England.”</p>

<p>“Your talk is madness! Have a care! The
punishment is death for one renouncing El Islâm.
Say, is that your meaning? Your own slaves will
kill you!”</p>

<p>He put the question in blood-curdling tones.
But Barakah, dissolved in tears, made no rejoinder.
A minute later he was once more at her side, imploring
mercy, declaring her his light of life, his
pearl of pearls. She still whimpered, “I shall tell
the Consul.”</p>

<p>At last she fell into a troubled sleep.</p>

<p>When she woke again it was broad daylight;
her coffee and a kind of pancake, which composed
her breakfast every morning, steamed upon a tray
beside her. Yûsuf had left the room. He came
back presently, and, kneeling down, implored her
to forget his madness. Enjoying her advantage in
a listless way, she put on an exaggerated air of
feebleness, and moaned:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a>[Pg 104]</span></p>

<p>“You were too cruel. I shall tell the Consul.”</p>

<p>At that he sprang up as a man demented and
rushed out. No sooner was he gone than she relapsed
to weeping, stricken by the curse of utter
helplessness which underlay her pitiful pretence at
pride. To have been beaten black and blue by
Yûsuf would have been less ignominious than to
let the Consul know she was unhappy. She had
walked into this guarded life with open eyes, aware
of the conditions which must thenceforth fetter
her existence, boasting love for them. The least
complaint, much more retreat, was thus impossible.
Even in the heat of anger she had had no real
intention to go back. Yûsuf had enraged her, the
mob upon the previous day had frightened her
exceedingly; but after all they were her chosen
people, though so strange. She could never come
to hate them as she did the English.</p>

<p>She rose at last with mind to go into another
room. The door was locked. Upon her trying
it a slave-girl shouted:</p>

<p>“It is forbidden to go out. Does my lady require
anything that I can bring her?”</p>

<p>Barakah bit her lip and flushed as she turned
back. Remembrance of her boasting yesterday
before those Englishwomen rose to taunt her.</p>

<p>A little sunlight entered through the lattice like
gold-dust. The gardener was at his work of
watering&mdash;a lengthy process&mdash;assisted by his little
son and by Ghandûr, Fatûmah playing round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a>[Pg 105]</span>
and teasing them. She heard their shouts and the
familiar noises marking stages of the work; and
by degrees, as she sat idle, listening, a measure of
contentment came to her. Her troubles were of
her own making; she had tempted Providence by
flouting rules she had herself accepted. Henceforth,
she vowed, she would be passive, of a boldness
purely speculative, like Gulbeyzah.</p>

<p>It was not very long before the room door opened,
admitting Yûsuf and his father, both with faces
of concern. Saluting, in his courtly way, the
Pasha offered an unqualified apology for everything
that might displease her in the customs of
the country. His son had told him of the trouble
which had come between them. It arose from a
simple and entirely pardonable misunderstanding,
as he hoped at once to demonstrate to her well-known
intelligence, if she would pay him the
distinguished compliment of attending for a little
moment to his explanation.</p>

<p>With that, he crossed one leg beneath him on the
sofa, a compromise between the Eastern and the
Western attitude, and began:</p>

<p>“I told you, if you will have the goodness to
remember, when first the question of a marriage
with my son arose between us, that we had stricter
rules for the protection of our women than prevail
in Europe. I also told you that, those rules once
honoured, a woman had all freedom and consideration.
I did wrong, I now perceive with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a>[Pg 106]</span>
infinite regret, not to explain to you precisely the
reason and the nature of those rules; for, see,
entirely owing to that fault of mine, you have
transgressed them innocently. I should like, if
you permit it, to expound their general tendency
and benevolent intention.”</p>

<p>Barakah was sore abashed. The Pasha’s entrance,
the intervention of so dignified a person in
a childish quarrel due to her misconduct, overwhelmed
her. At this point in his speech she interjected:</p>

<p>“Pardon! I did wrong, I know! But I had
no idea ... I wore the habbarah and mouth-veil.
You had told me that a woman dressed like that
was safe from insult.”</p>

<p>“I spoke in too general a sense. It is my fault
entirely. You sinned through ignorance, and
Yûsuf should not have been angry&mdash;though, indeed,
to our ideas your conduct was abominable.”</p>

<p>“But what wrong did I do, beyond going out
without permission? Why did the people on the
road beset me? Oh, I am so miserable!”</p>

<p>The Pasha shrugged his shoulders with a smile
to Yûsuf, as who should say:</p>

<p>“Observe her innocence!”</p>

<p>“No, no, don’t cry, I beg of you!” he pleaded.
“God be praised you have derived no hurt from
the adventure. It is entirely owing to respect for
you that I and my son are so concerned about it.
Beloved daughter, women are for us so sacred&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a>[Pg 107]</span>
spirit of the house, the secret fount of life&mdash;that we
never even speak of them with friends for fear
some light word or unseemly thought should go
towards them. Nothing must be known of them,
no talk made about them, outside the world of
women and our own harîm.</p>

<p>“Yesterday, by going out alone in an open
carriage, you attracted notice all unconsciously.
Your habbarah is of a rich material, your mouth-veil
of the kind only worn by ladies of good houses.
No such lady would have gone abroad thus unattended.
The servants of your English friend
would comment on the strange proceeding, and,
knowing who you were, think shame of us.</p>

<p>“But that is the least part of what you did.
That, by itself, would have been nothing. But
you walked. Great God! What made you walk?
That is for me inexplicable!”</p>

<p>“I felt the wish to walk. It was a lovely
evening.”</p>

<p>“Great God!” the Pasha gasped, with eyes upturned.
“Does anybody walk for pleasure here
in Egypt? The natives have a proverb: ‘Better
ride on beetles than walk upon rich carpets.’ Well,
well, there!” He shrugged as giving up a hopeless
puzzle. “You walked. A lady dressed as
you were had never been seen walking in this
world before. More than that, you did not walk
like other people. Ghandûr informs me that the
rascals who beset you were all persuaded that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a>[Pg 108]</span>
were a man dressed up. You say you walked for
pleasure in the dust?&mdash;and in a habbarah?
Astonishing!</p>

<p>“So, you see now, Yûsuf was not angry altogether
without cause. I trust you will not now
esteem it necessary to see the Consul, and produce
a scandal which I think would kill me.”</p>

<p>Thoroughly disgusted with her whole behaviour,
Barakah began to sob again.</p>

<p>“I never truly meant to go,” she blurted.</p>

<p>“I thank you infinitely,” said the Pasha grandly,
again saluting as he rose to go. “You relieve me of
a terrible anxiety. Our house has never known the
breath of scandal.... But pleasure!&mdash;you assure
me that you walked for pleasure?” he gasped,
reverting to the former wonder. “I could understand
it in a garden, round and round. But when
it is a case of going anywhere&mdash;Grand Dieu!”</p>

<p>That was a marvel which for weeks convulsed the
harîm world. The Pasha mentioned it at home.
Within an hour the wondrous news was known to
every woman. The English bride of Yûsuf Bey
Muhammad had walked from such a house to such
a crossways, all in thick dust, amid the crowd of
wayfarers&mdash;for pleasure, so she said! Insanity,
a love appointment with an Englishman, a touch of
sunstroke, the insensibility to comfort of a woman
of coarse origin, were solutions of the riddle freely
offered and discussed. But the theory which
found most favour for its probability was that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a>[Pg 109]</span>
the Englishwoman was the sport of some malignant
wizard or afrît, who made her walk to show
his power upon her.</p>

<p>Leylah Khânum and Gulbeyzah were the first
to call and question her upon the strange performance.
They asked point-blank why she had
walked; and when she answered, “Just for exercise,”
they eyed her in a way that showed they
thought her mad. Then came the throng of mere
acquaintances, not less curious, but infinitely too
polite to ask a question; who watched for symptoms
of derangement through the flow of compliments.
The elderly princess, Amînah Khânum, alone
showed understanding and some sympathy.</p>

<p>“My dear,” she said, “you’ve set the parrots
talking. Do you know that ‘durrah,’ which means
fellow-wife, means parrot too? Bear that in mind.
Their tongues!&mdash;They fail to comprehend. They
think you are bewitched or mad. For me, your
conduct was entirely natural. But I fancy you
will give up walking here in Egypt. Were not your
clothes a mass of dust beneath your habbarah?
Whenever you are in a difficulty, come to me. I
have some jurisdiction, and I wish you happy.”</p>

<p>Barakah was far from happy in those days.
For one thing, she had felt the bars confining her.
And then a vision of the English sneering lurked
ever in the background of her mind, a fount of
gall. With Yûsuf she was once more upon loving
terms, and any differences that arose between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a>[Pg 110]</span>
them came from her ill-temper. She was growing
irritable. The food, too highly spiced, did not agree
with her; the sanitary arrangements were disgusting;
she noticed failings not observed before,
particularly in the behaviour of the servants to her.</p>

<p>At first, on coming to that nest of love, released
from the restrictions of a great harîm, her slave-girls
had been lazy, but obsequious. At that time
the old woman had commanded them, relieving
Barakah, whose little knowledge of the language
would have placed her at their mercy. But now
the crone had been dismissed; the servants, with
respect diminished by the quarrel they had witnessed,
were grown insolent and off-hand in their
service. The child Fatûmah, who had been a pet
with Barakah, made rude grimaces and ran off when
called.</p>

<p>One hot midday, feeling extremely ill, she
called for water. There came no answer, though
she heard them chattering. She called again and
clapped her hands. Still no one came. The
cruelty of such neglect incensed her. With fevered
strength she rose and went to scold them. She
met a slave arriving at her leisure. At the words,
“Ready, O my lady!” proffered with an undisguised
yawn, she sprang upon the girl and
clutched her throat, exclaiming: “Bring water,
dost thou hear, O daughter of a dog! Bring water
quickly!”</p>

<p>The slave, beholding murder in the lady’s eyes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a>[Pg 111]</span>
made haste and ran. Another girl looked in to
learn the reason of the noise. Barakah picked up an
earthen jar and flung it at her head. The change
was magical. In a trice five several vessels full
of water were being offered to her by as many
servile creatures; while Fatûmah snuggled up to
her and kissed her hand, receiving in return a box
on the ear, which made her howl the praises of
her dear, kind mistress.</p>

<p>When Barakah returned to her own room she
fainted, her borrowed strength departing with her
wrath. The servants, in a flutter of solicitude,
put her to bed, and sent Ghandûr to fetch the
master. She, knowing nothing of the flight of time,
heard presently, as in a dream, the Pasha saying:</p>

<p>“Call a European doctor! That dog must
know that she has had the best attendance!”
and Yûsuf weeping uncontrollably. Then the
next minute, as it seemed to her, an English voice
above her muttered: “Typhoid! Bound to come,
with native food.” That was the last she knew.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>


<p>Ghandûr, had borne the summons to the Frankish
doctor. Having delivered it, he wandered to the
Pasha’s house. A creature witless save for love,
existing by it, the kindness shown him by the lady
Barakah had raised her to the throne of Yûsuf
in his mind. Her freak of walking had imparted
to his sentiments that touch of pity for one
too innocent to face the world which makes of
service an angelic trust. He blamed himself for
the adventure. When he heard that she was in
disgrace and looking wan, he beat his breast. Now
that she was like to die through his demerits, his
grief was such as caused him actual pains.</p>

<p>Upon arriving at Muhammad Pasha’s house, before
he could divulge his woe, he was informed:</p>

<p>“The lady Fitnah has been asking for thee. Go
indoors, and wait while they announce thee!”</p>

<p>He was standing in the hall, cocooned in sorrow,
when a mob of children burst through the mabeyn,
as the great screen which bounds the women’s realm
is called, and fell upon him.</p>

<p>“Oh, Ghandûr, where hast thou been?”&mdash;“I
have a new tarbûsh.”&mdash;“The bitch beneath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a>[Pg 113]</span>
our windows has five puppies&mdash;blind, by Allah’s
mercy! Come and see!”&mdash;“My doll! Like a
daughter of Adam&mdash;a bride arrayed&mdash;a virgin&mdash;almost
a sin for thee to look on! Come and see!”</p>

<p>Half weeping as he was, Ghandûr responded;
and, unaware of his preoccupation, the children
led him towards the women’s doorway.</p>

<p>“Go in as far as to the second screen&mdash;no
farther!” said the eunuch there on guard.</p>

<p>Ghandûr was careful to obey; but his attendant
imps, regarding all authority as ground for sport,
banded together suddenly and dragged him on. He
shook them off and drew back quickly; the eunuch
came and scattered them with swishing cane; and
then the children, tumbling over one another, began
to fight among themselves with fearful insults.</p>

<p>“By my maidenhood, I swear to kill thee and
devour thy liver!” screamed out a girl of eight to
a small boy who pushed against her.</p>

<p>“I will ravish thee, abandoned one, and then
eject thee on a dunghill!”</p>

<p>The lady Fitnah from behind the screen cried
out for order, naming Hamdi, her own son, as probably
the cause of tumult. The eunuch fell upon
that wayward, dreamy adolescent, whom Ghandûr
did his utmost to protect, for he was Yûsuf’s
brother; while Fitnah Khânum asked what sin
she had committed to be punished with a boy so
lazy and so mischievous. She cared for Hamdi,
but without indulgence. Her love was made a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a>[Pg 114]</span>
whip-lash for his good. At last came silence, and
Ghandûr poured forth his grief.</p>

<p>“O Lord, have mercy! Woe upon us all! O
most gracious lady, rare pearl of beauty and refinement,
companion of my dearest lord and
brother! Behold the glory of our house is in the
dust.”</p>

<p>“By Allah, in the dust! Thou sayest truly!”
scoffed the lady Fitnah. “It is of that very business
that I wish to speak with thee. What is the
truth about her walking in the dust, thou who wast
with her? Is it true that she had been alone with
Frankish men? Was no man following&mdash;didst
thou look well?&mdash;when she walked off alone, rejecting
thee? Was not her chin upon her shoulder,
and her gaze behind her, ogling? Did I not well
to rail against that marriage? Now it is clearly
proven that she has no modesty.”</p>

<p>“O my despair! O evil day! The fault is
mine!” cried out Ghandûr, beside himself. “Blame
not her Grace; she is the noblest lady&mdash;as innocent
as is a babe; she thinks no evil. O bitter grief!
O Allah! O calamity!”</p>

<p>“Now Allah heal thee! It is plain she has bewitched
thee too. She is for all men, like the rest
of her foul race&mdash;for strangers, servants, donkey-drivers,
even scavengers! Pray, pray to God till
I bestow on thee a charm of power!”</p>

<p>“Hush! Let him speak! Let Ghandûr tell
his story!” cried a second voice. Ghandûr became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a>[Pg 115]</span>
aware of other ladies pressing to the screen. He
lifted up his voice and wept.</p>

<p>“O lady, speak no bitterness against her. She
lies this moment at the point of death. Our house
is as a tomb, a haunt of ominous owls. My lord the
Pasha frowns and looks distressful; my lord Yûsuf
weeps as if his heart would break. I myself have
been to call a Frankish doctor, who, on reading my
lord’s message, rode off like the wind. Allah knows
the dear one may be dead this minute!”</p>

<p>He buried his face in his hands, while a hubbub
of concern arose behind the screen.</p>

<p>“O poor darling floweret! O despair!” wailed
Yûsuf’s mother, all her feelings turned right round.
“What is her illness? Quick, describe! May
Allah heal her!”</p>

<p>“Fever&mdash;the worst sort!”</p>

<p>“I go at once to her.”</p>

<p>A sick-nurse of experience in charms and nostrums,
the lady Fitnah always quickened to the
scent of illness and adored the sufferer. From a
creature hardly to be named by modest lips, the
wife of Yûsuf was become the apple of her eye
Having sent an order for the carriage, she went
through her store of medicines, discoursing wisely
to the other ladies; while Ghandûr, retiring, heard
from the attendant eunuch:</p>

<p>“Thou hast done it! We had word of this; Sawwâb
was summoned. But the command was, not
to tell the ladies.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a>[Pg 116]</span></p>

<p>He could only shrug.</p>

<p>Illness, like death and birth, was woman’s
great occasion, when, guarding the traditions, she
stood forth as priestess. The whole harîm was in a
flutter of excitement.</p>

<p>“Gulbeyzah must come with us,” pronounced
Fitnah Khânum, “because our poor sick darling
always loved her.”</p>

<p>The ladies Fitnah and Murjânah, the Pasha’s
widowed sister and two nieces, goodly persons, together
with the well-grown, plump Gulbeyzah, and
a bundle of medicaments, including a whole plant
of garlic and a donkey’s thigh-bone, were all packed
somehow into one close carriage. The sun was
setting when they reached the pleasure-house. The
eunuch went to herald their arrival; and all the
ladies, nothing doubting of their glad reception,
freed themselves from the crushed mass they
formed together. They were shaking out and
smoothing crumpled raiment when the messenger
returned to say they were refused admittance by
the doctor’s orders. The ladies stood stone-still
and looked at one another. Fitnah Khânum broke
the silence.</p>

<p>“This is our son’s house! May Allah slay the
doctor! Come, my sisters!”</p>

<p>Just then Sawwâb, chief eunuch of the guard,
appeared, and barred the entrance with the word
“Forbidden!”</p>

<p>“Whose order, say?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a>[Pg 117]</span></p>

<p>“The order of our lord.”</p>

<p>“Praise to Allah! That is better than the
doctor. To hear is to obey, though Allah knows
that the command is wicked and against religion.
Tell thy master we shall lay a case before the
Câdi.”</p>

<p>With this menace, which afforded her some
satisfaction, Fitnah Khânum turned back towards
the carriage; and the work of packing those
redundant bodies was performed anew.</p>

<p>“Heard one ever the like? To hide our dearest
from us at the point of death! To keep a mother
from a daughter’s sick-bed&mdash;a woman from a
woman! O Protector!”</p>

<p>The incident, when known, incensed the harîm
world. The sick-room had been woman’s temple
from of old. To be forbidden access to the bedside
of a near relation appeared an outrage, even to the
calm Murjânah. The indignation of the slaves was
riotous. The injured ladies received many visits
of condolence, when Fitnah Khânum’s lamentations
were applauded as the voice of right.</p>

<p>“O cruelty,” she sobbed. “To keep us from
our darling, when she has most need of us! The
Frankish doctors are all monsters, hearts of stone.
It is known that they snatch dying people from
their friends, to practise on them, omitting even
to return the bodies afterwards. They may have
skill, but many things they know not, being infidels.
The pain I suffer when I think of that sweet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a>[Pg 118]</span>
girl&mdash;the very liver of my darling Yûsuf&mdash;lying
senseless, an empty house for any demon to inhabit,
and not a charm put up for her protection,
is excruciating!”</p>

<p>It is characteristic of the harîm life that, though
the ladies were thus irritated, near rebellion, no clear
word of their grievance reached the Pasha’s ear.
There is a wall between the women and the man
more real than the mabeyn screen which man
erected. The women raise it to secure their privileges;
the man, if he perceives it, cannot throw it
down. His anger meets with a subservience which
foils its aim as surely as loose sheets will stop a
bullet. Even Murjânah, who adored the Pasha,
kept the harîm secret.</p>

<p>Fitnah Khânum had foretold that Barakah would
die, thanks to the ministrations of the Frankish
doctor. When she heard that she was fast recovering,
she gave praise to Allah, who had saved her life
in spite of them. From wishing well to the sick
woman, she had grown to love her with all the
strength of her impulsive, loyal nature.</p>

<p>The love she bore to Yûsuf was eclipsed. His
neglect of her for weeks was scarcely noticed.
When at last he did appear, haggard but joyful,
her “Praise to Allah” was upon his wife’s account.
She made him tell her every detail of the doctor’s
treatment, and vowed it was a miracle the girl survived
it. From him she learnt the reason of the
Pasha’s deference to every edict of that ignoramus.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a>[Pg 119]</span>
The English Consul had his eye upon the house,
watching to note that all was done correctly.</p>

<p>“Consume the Consul!” she exclaimed peremptorily.</p>

<p>“Our Lord consume him utterly!” said Yûsuf.
“Yet for one boon I have to thank him. My father,
to propitiate him, gives command that I shall visit
Paris in the summer with my bride.”</p>

<p>“Allah forbid!” his mother screamed in horror.
“Our pearl of pearls to be exposed to vulgar handling,
to be cast back into the mire from which she
was with pains extracted! Thou wilt not suffer
her to go unveiled? For shame, O Yûsuf! To
let foul infidels survey thy secret joy.”</p>

<p>“Nay, she will veil her face as the Frenchwomen
use.”</p>

<p>“Those veils are nothing, for the mouth is
visible.”</p>

<p>“Our ladies wear them in that country to avoid
publicity. Be reassured, my mother; we shall
guard the decencies. My father grumbles greatly
at the cost, but vows that he will show the Consul
we are not fanatical. We go to see the dog tomorrow,
to tell him all that we have done for her.”</p>

<p>But on the morrow Yûsuf and his father met
with cruel disconcertion. The Consul welcomed
them and listened to their story with politeness,
but at its end he murmured blandly:</p>

<p>“I altogether fail to see how this concerns me,
though highly honoured by your visit and your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a>[Pg 120]</span>
confidence. The lady is, no doubt, extremely
fortunate.”</p>

<p>Muhammad Pasha, flushing hotly, licked his lips
as might a panther, and glanced sidelong at his
son. He offered a profusion of excuses as he rose
to go. The Consul answered, “Always charmed!”
and smiled them out.</p>

<p>“May the All-Powerful corrupt his bones and
blind him! May the All-Merciful frustrate his
heart’s desire!” exclaimed the Pasha as the two
regained their carriage. “It seems he has deceived
us, has renounced all claim. Here have I spent
more than I can afford&mdash;coined money, hard to
come by&mdash;what with her establishment, this
doctor and the nursing, and that trip to Paris,
which cannot now be dropped, for I have boasted
of it; and lo! the dog cares nothing for my trouble.
May his limbs rot off!”</p>

<p>“May Allah cut his life!” said Yûsuf savagely.</p>

<p>The women never heard that tale of shame.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>


<p>With the return of reason a new spirit came to
Barakah. At the moment of her seizure she had
been exasperated with her Eastern life. She
awoke to rapture in it, to impatience of the European
nurse and doctor. The smell of them, as they
leaned over her, was an offence; their voices
jarred so that often she would hide her head
beneath the bed-clothes to shut out the sound.</p>

<p>On the other hand, she listened eagerly to noises
out of doors&mdash;the creak of the shadûf which tipped
up water on the garden, the camel-bells, the chant
of passing funerals; she watched the sunlight
stud with gems the inky lacework of her lattice,
and eagerly inhaled the breeze which entered;
and Yûsuf’s daily visits were her joy. In the
forest of distorted memories through which her
soul had wandered friendless like a ragged child,
the Europeans she encountered had reviled her;
the love of Yûsuf and his people had been all her
hope.</p>

<p>In the hunger which distressed her convalescence,
the growing disaffection for a diet all of milk, her
fancy pictured feasts of Eastern dishes, English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a>[Pg 122]</span>
cookery appearing loathsome in the memory.
Strangest of all, she could now think in Arabic,
of which, before her illness, she had scarce a sentence.</p>

<p>As soon as she had licence to see visitors, the
Pasha’s harîm came in force to greet her. The
lady Fitnah fell upon her in a transport of affection,
and she responded with entire abandonment,
thankful to have at last the love of Yûsuf’s mother.
The elderly princess, Amînah Khânum, and other
ladies of importance, paid her visits and, as her
health improved, carried her off to their own houses&mdash;not
for an hour, but for whole days together.
There, in the perfumed shade, she was enthroned
with cushions, fanned and sprinkled, nourished
delicately, and sung to sleep when she showed
signs of weariness. The sense of frailty and of
worth was exquisite. She was content to be the
guarded pet, and let them plan; regarding them as
beings of a higher race, with whom it would be
vanity to try to cope. Their freedom from the
sentimental mists of Europe helped this feeling,
and so did their bold vision of existence, blinking
nothing. The potential cruelty which lurked
beneath their gentleness subdued her; the way
they talked of death habitually made her feel a
timid child.</p>

<p>Thus, with the body pampered and the mind
enslaved, she studied and observed their life,
completely fascinated. The world of women was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a>[Pg 123]</span>
she found, a great republic, with liberties extending
to the meanest slave, and something of the
strength which comes of solidarity. Unless in
jealous fury, no woman would inform against
another, bond or free; nor fail to help her in the
hour of need. They had their shibboleths, their
customs, rites, and ceremonies, even their courts
of justice, independent of the world of men. Each
lady owning slaves controlled them absolutely.
Her husband never saw their faces, hardly knew
them. The law against his making love among
them, except by her command, was very drastic.
The child of such a union would have been her
slave. If he required a concubine, he had to buy,
not steal one. So sacred with the Muslims was
the married woman’s right to property&mdash;a right
which was not recognized at all in England
Occasionally Barakah heard talk of cruelties
which chilled her blood; but her friends excused
them on the ground of anger, which was for them a
visitation from on high. The very victims, they
assured her, never felt as she did.</p>

<p>One feature of the harîm life which shocked her
was the equalling of black with white. The Muslim
faith disowning all race prejudice, a strain of negro
blood appeared in the best families; and any
negro having fortune was esteemed as marriageable
as the fairest Turk. Then the black slaves,
though less regarded because they cost less than
the white Circassians, possessed great influence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a>[Pg 124]</span>
particularly in the article of superstition, which
they quite controlled. Weeds from the heathen
Soudan, brought to Cairo in the convoy of the
slave-dealer, luxuriated in that tank of guarded
ignorance; and many an enlightened Muslim
would have died of horror had he known the works
of darkness countenanced by his harîm&mdash;the
sacrifices to malignant beings; the veneration
paid to hoary negresses for demoniacal possession;
the use to which the name of God was sometimes
put. To Barakah, however, in those early days,
such fancies&mdash;what she heard of them&mdash;seemed
merely comic. She ranked them with the women’s
playfulness, their funny stories. She was enamoured
of their life as she conceived it, enslaved
and thrilled by its unblushing candour. This was
the season of her real conversion, which reached
its climax on a certain morning, when she was
carried in a guarded litter to the citadel to witness
the departure of the yearly pilgrimage. From a
place reserved for ladies on the ramparts she
beheld the troops, the guilds of dervishes, defile
before the Khedive’s tent, and then the great procession
wind away. Fanfares sounded, cannons
roared, and from the multitude which hid the
square and covered every roof and balcony in
sight, beading with heads the very summits of the
citadel, a sigh went up.</p>

<p>Barakah was in an ecstasy. When her eyes
wearied of the flash and movement, she surveyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a>[Pg 125]</span>
the vast blue sky, the coloured, sunlit walls, the
minarets where doves were circling. She pictured
the long journey of the pilgrims, on the shining sea,
across the burning sands, to the eternal sanctuary.
What scene in Christian Europe could be matched
with this? Religion, but a mummy there, here
lived and moved.</p>

<p>Returning home, she felt a craving to unbosom,
and bethought her of a girl in England, once her
friend. She called for ink and pens, and wrote forthwith
to Julia Long, recounting her changed fortunes,
and extolling Egypt. She described the scene she
had that morning witnessed, and concluded:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Julia darling, you will think it strange, but I am
sure that this religion is the true one. Here every
woman has a chance to marry, and the accidents
of wealth and birth are not the barriers they are at
home. Polygamy is not at all what people think.
The Moslems are as strict as Puritans about morality;
and the women here are happier than those
at home. Europe has gone all wrong, and so has
Christianity. Here we believe in Jesus just as you
do: we know that His religion is the true one; but
St. Paul and others after him corrupted it. Do
think of this, and learn about Mahometanism. I
would give anything that you might find the happiness
that I have found. My husband will be taking
me to Paris at the end of June. Do try and join
us there. We will pay all expenses.</p>

<p>“With true affection from your old friend</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a>[Pg 126]</span></p>

<p>This letter was read out to Yûsuf in the evening.
He applauded it, and vowed she had a natural gift
of eloquence. He asked for a minute description
of her friend, seeming much pleased to think that
they would meet in Paris; and when Barakah had
satisfied him to the best of her remembrance,
chuckled:</p>

<p>“And you love her? Then you would not object
to have her for your durrah!”</p>

<p>She warned him archly that she could be jealous.</p>

<p>Barakah called often on the lady Fitnah, who
just now was in high feather, having been commissioned
by Murjânah Khânum to find out a husband
for the latter’s slave, Gulbeyzah. At once
she sent out go-betweens in all directions, threads
of a gigantic web, in which she sat and waited.
Flies soon came&mdash;ladies with eligible sons or husbands
needing matrimony&mdash;whose claims the
shrewd Egyptian sifted, smelling out the slightest
fraud. Barakah was interested in these doings,
naturally, seeing they concerned the welfare of her
closest friend.</p>

<p>Murjânah Khânum wished to emancipate a
charming slave and place her in a good position, at
the same time seeking some remuneration for her
previous outlay. She appointed Fitnah Khânum
her intendant. Those were the naked facts. But
the word “price” was never mentioned in discussion
of the subject; it was always “dowry,” of
which a third part would be paid, of course, to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a>[Pg 127]</span>
bride’s people. Gulbeyzah was referred to as a
cherished daughter of the house; her wishes were
consulted with regard to each proposal; and no one
was annoyed when she seemed hard to please.</p>

<p>“Thou art like Leylah Khânum,” whispered
Barakah. “Thou wilt choose and choose away till
none are left.”</p>

<p>“By no means,” was the laughing answer. “I
am a young maid. Moreover, it is not the man I
stickle for; it is society.”</p>

<p>Whenever ladies whom she did not choose came
to inspect her, Gulbeyzah donned a rustic air and
talked to shock them. Barakah had no idea of
what she meant when saying she required society,
until one day she told her:</p>

<p>“Praise to Allah! Only think, beloved! Three
Circassians, young like me, from the same district!
Their lord&mdash;a Pasha of the richest&mdash;wants another
like them. They are gratified. I have been recommended.
They come to-day for my inspection.
Thou shalt see them presently, as also a Gulbeyzah
no one ever saw before. O day of milk! O wave-crest
of all days!”</p>

<p>Barakah had been summoned by the ladies and
a carriage sent for her. Gulbeyzah had waylaid
her on the way to the reception-room.</p>

<p>“But what of the man&mdash;the husband?” she
inquired.</p>

<p>“Splendid! Rich and generous; impartial as
the prophet in division of his favours. If God wills,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a>[Pg 128]</span>
I shall bear him children. What more could girl
require? Think&mdash;four of us, like sisters! Four
pearls strung together, and inseparable! Thou
wilt visit us, and we shall all four love thee
dearly. O joy! Now go! I will rejoin thee
presently.”</p>

<p>The clack of tongues was heard from the reception-room.
Before the door stood rows of coloured
slippers. All the dependants of the household, all
the go-betweens, had rallied to support the ladies on
a great occasion. Hardly had Barakah concluded
greetings ere the three Circassians were announced.
They were all charming, and all bore, she fancied,
some resemblance to Gulbeyzah in their childlike
faces and huge eyes. They had pretty, deferential
manners, seeming to speak by pre-arrangement
and to think in concert, obedient to some rule which
bound them, just like nuns. They were still amid
the storm of formal compliments when Gulbeyzah
entered clad in soft apparel, and paused as if in awe
at finding strangers. Then, blushingly, she went
and kissed their hands, going on to kiss the hands
of all the ladies present. In so doing she gave
Barakah a little bite, and when her tour was ended
sank down humbly at her feet.</p>

<p>“They will unmask thee. Thou canst never
keep this up for life,” the Englishwoman whispered.</p>

<p>“By Allah! only look!” was the reply. “They
too are acting. See now, the plump one: there is
inward mirth.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a>[Pg 129]</span></p>

<p>The visitors, impressed by her demeanour, put
certain questions, which she answered to the point.
It appeared that she could dance and sing; spoke
Turkish, Arabic, and some Armenian. At mention
of French also, they raised hands and eyes, declaring
her a perfect prodigy. They then addressed her in
their native dialect, when sudden smiles broke up
their shy decorum. Turning to the hostesses, they
asked forgiveness for employing private speech.
They had but asked the dear one of her native
village, and smiled to hear that it adjoined their
own. They begged for leave to call again, which
meant the bargain was acceptable; and then withdrew
with every blessing on the house.</p>

<p>No sooner had they vanished than Gulbeyzah
threw off her demureness and performed with energy
a naughty dance which terminated in a sudden
swoop to clasp Murjânah Khânum’s feet. Her
mistress bent and kissed her forehead tenderly; the
lady Fitnah was convulsed with glee; the humbler
women gave forth wedding-cries. And the cause
of all this joy, the object of that motherly consideration,
was a slave! In Europe, people thought of
slaves as miserable. Here was a story to be told
to Julia Long.</p>

<p>“O disappointment! Thou wilt be in Paris!
Thou wilt miss my wedding!” cried Gulbeyzah
suddenly. “Yûsuf Bey should take some low girl
with him since he needs must go. It is sinful to
expose thy worth to risks of travel.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a>[Pg 130]</span></p>

<p>“Have I not told him?” cried the lady Fitnah.
“The world will be quite black when she is gone.
A girl for whom his father paid three thousand
pounds. It is absurd to fling her into boats and
filthy trains.”</p>

<p>Barakah smiled at their desire to keep her, thinking
with rapture of the coming talks with Julia.
She had not then had Julia’s answer to her letter.
It arrived within a fortnight of the time of starting.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“ ... How can you write such wickedness?...
I heard that you had married a Turk, but thought
of course he was converted.... I do not envy
you your riches nor your rank at such a price!...
No, I will not join you in Paris, and abet you in your
infamy. I banish your most impious suggestions
from my thoughts for ever.... I am poor and shall
remain so; but I have incalculable treasure....”</p></blockquote>

<p>She crumpled up the closely written sheets, then
flung them on the ground and stamped upon them.
Yûsuf found her weeping uncontrollably, and asked
the cause.</p>

<p>“Then their women are fanatical like ours!” he
sighed when told. “Take heart, O fountain of my
life! By Allah, such a friend is not worth weeping.
We will none the less enjoy ourselves in Paris.”</p>

<p>“I have no wish to go at all,” sobbed Barakah.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>


<p>Ghandûr attended Yûsuf in the train to Alexandria,
and accompanied the pair on board the
steamer. Kissing hands at parting he wept uncontrollably,
and in that condition was propelled
by sailors to the boat awaiting him. Barakah
would have liked to stand and watch the harbour,
which offered charming pictures in the evening
glow; but Yûsuf drew her down into a stuffy cabin,
where he left her, bidding her secure the door
against intrusion. He told her she must take her
meals down there, since there was no separate
dining-room assigned to women. Directly afterwards
his voice resounded in the corridor, with
others talking Arabic, by which she knew that he
had friends on board.</p>

<p>A stewardess knocked at her door, bringing her
supper, which consisted of a single dish of meat and
vegetables. By then the pulse of engines could be
felt; there was a noise of running overhead,
shouts, and the clank of chains; the ship was
moving. Having made an end of eating, she
retired to bed and, being tired, went to sleep immediately.
The slamming of the door by Yûsuf<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a>[Pg 132]</span>
partly roused her. She could hear him swearing,
asking Allah to be put on shore, and knew that he
was sea-sick; but it seemed no matter. Next
morning, as the sea was rather rough, she kept
her bunk until eleven o’clock, when she got up and
put on English clothes she had brought with her.
Yûsuf, more dead than living, asked what for.</p>

<p>“I go to smell the air.”</p>

<p>He sobbed: “With face exposed! Behold me
dead, while dogs defile my grave.”</p>

<p>Supposing his mind wandered&mdash;for she wore the
English veil which he himself had said would be
sufficient after leaving Egypt&mdash;she found her way
on to the deck and spent an hour there, pacing
up and down, enjoying the strong wind. When
she returned to Yûsuf he was inarticulate. She
stayed with him until the evening, when she went on
deck again for a few minutes before turning in. It
was five days before the gale abated.</p>

<p>At length one morning they awoke to ease of
movement, and Yûsuf rose. His smile was tentative
at first, but soon grew confident. “I could not tell
thee for my sickness,” he informed her, “but there
are common people of our faith on board. I would
not have their talk asperse my wife. It mattered
less while I myself made no appearance. No doubt
they took thee for some Frankish woman. But
now keep close in here. Wait till we get to Fransa.”</p>

<p>Without waiting for her answer, he went out.
But in a minute he was back again, exclaiming:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a>[Pg 133]</span></p>

<p>“The wife of Hâfiz Bey, my friend, lies near to
death! Come thou and see what can be done
for her, and God reward thee! Put on thy
habbarah. My friend will guide thee.”</p>

<p>It was the first time he had spoken of his friends
to her. She followed him and was presented to
a fat, good-tempered-looking youth, exceeding
swarthy, clad in a European suit too tight for
him, who apologized in baby French for thus
“deranging” her. He opened the door of an
adjacent cabin, bowed her in, and then retreated
arm in arm with Yûsuf.</p>

<p>It was a two-berth cabin. In the lower bunk a
buxom girl of eighteen years or less&mdash;a perfect
blonde&mdash;lay with her eyes closed, making moan
with every breath. The childish face was flushed,
discoloured round the eyes with weeping; the hands
clenched. Whatever her complaint, it was not
sea-sickness.</p>

<p>“How is thy health?” the visitor asked softly.</p>

<p>“O Lord! I die! I perish! O fresh air!
O sun!” gasped out the sufferer. “O Allah!
Was I born a fish to be thus thrown upon the sea&mdash;a
snake, to be imprisoned in this box?”</p>

<p>“Be brave! The voyage is now almost ended.
In two days or three, at most, we are released.
Tell me thy pains! What ails thee?”</p>

<p>The prostrate beauty opened great blue eyes
of injured innocence and asked: “Who art
thou?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a>[Pg 134]</span></p>

<p>“I am the wife of Yûsuf Bey, thy husband’s
friend.”</p>

<p>“The Englishwoman!” She sat up and clung
to Barakah. “How canst thou bear it, thou, an
honoured wife! Will not thy parents take account
for the indignity? Oh, end my life, I pray thee; it
is unendurable!”</p>

<p>Slowly, by force of patience, Barakah elicited
that the girl, by name Bedr-ul-Budûr, a pet slave
of the mother of young Hâfiz Bey, had been presented
to him for his comfort on this journey,
since his bride, of high ideas, refused to travel.
She had been a little frightened in the train, a new
experience, but much elated till she came on board
this ship and felt the sea. Then she realized that
she had been beguiled, defrauded, enticed to an
undignified and hideous death. Hiccuping sobs
broke in upon her narrative, which ended in a
storm of tears.</p>

<p>Barakah tried to soothe her mind with cheerful
talk, depicting all the charms of life in Paris.</p>

<p>“Thy voice is sweetness!” she entreated.
“Stay with me! Turn out my consort: let him
house with thine. What does one want with men
when one is dying?”</p>

<p>Going out on that injunction, Barakah found
Hâfiz and her husband waiting close at hand. The
former, greatly scared by his companion’s illness,
was prepared for any sacrifice to save her life;
and Yûsuf raising no objection, Barakah’s effects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a>[Pg 135]</span>
were moved into the other cabin, while Hâfiz took
his baggage to the “house of Yûsuf,” as he called
it, jesting.</p>

<p>Bedr-ul-Budûr gave praise to Allah. The presence
of a lady of acknowledged standing relieved
her of the sense of singular and base ill-treatment,
which was all her illness.</p>

<p>At length the ship stood still and filled with
voices. It was night. The men called from the
corridor to warn them that the landing would take
place at the third hour next morning. Thus
bidden, they took out their Frankish garments
and compared them.</p>

<p>Barakah’s were old, of sober hue. Bedr-ul-Budûr’s
brand-new and something garish. They
slept but little, talking through the night.</p>

<p>When Barakah had finished dressing in the early
morning, her companion, waking, screamed with
horror at the English veil.</p>

<p>“Merciful Allah! It is dreadful. It hides
nothing. It is what the wantons wear. Wait but
a minute! I have more than one. I will provide
thee. My kind princess advised me what was
right to wear.”</p>

<p>Tumbling out of her berth, Bedr-ul-Budûr found
in her box a fold of thick white gauze, which she
proceeded to throw round the face of Barakah,
attaching it to the bonnet with two little brooches.</p>

<p>“By Allah, that is better!” she remarked, and
then gave all her mind to her own dressing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a>[Pg 136]</span></p>

<p>When this was finished, her appearance smote
the eye. Her bonnet was sky-blue, the thick white
veil depending from it like a curtain, her dress a
lively pink, her stockings white, her boots and
gloves bright yellow, shining in their newness; she
had a pale blue parasol adorned with frills of
lace.</p>

<p>“The Franks wear many colours,” she remarked
to Barakah, adding with childish wonder, “Why
are yours so dull?... By Allah, I feel naked in the
middle.”</p>

<p>So did Barakah. To one accustomed to go
shrouded, a dress which emphasized the hips and
bust seemed vile at first.</p>

<p>Yûsuf and Hâfiz fetched them up on deck, where
they found two more ladies garishly arrayed, and
two more men in French-made suits and fezes.</p>

<p>After the introduction all stood awkwardly,
gaping like children who have lost remembrance of
their part. Barakah, to ease the strain, remarked
to Hâfiz Bey upon the beauty of the morning, the
bustle of the harbour of Marseilles; but his response
was marred by evident embarrassment; his eyes
kept veering round to look at Yûsuf, whom he soon
rejoined. The ladies formed a group apart, in
titters at each other’s odd appearance. Presently
a man, clad as a Frank, approached with Arab
greetings. He kissed the hand of Hâfiz Bey, who
welcomed him. It seemed he had been warned by
letter to prepare the way for them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a>[Pg 137]</span></p>

<p>“All is ready, lords of bounty!” he exclaimed.
“Deign but to follow me, the ladies with you.”</p>

<p>The drive along the quays through noisy streets
to the hotel, the breakfast which their guide
assured them had been cooked and chosen in accordance
with religious law, were trammelled by
constraint, and went off sadly. Only in the train,
where they were separated, each sex enjoying
a reserved compartment, did conversation flow.
Among the women it was soon uproarious. They
talked and laughed half through the night, appealing
constantly to Barakah, a European born, for
information. The appearance of the men at every
station, to ascertain that they were well, produced
a hush; but no sooner were the despots gone again
than the mad talk and laughter raged anew.</p>

<p>At length they tired and tried to rest. They
cursed the narrowness of the divans, the work of
devils. When morning came, Bedr-ul-Budûr was
at the point of death once more, asking her Maker
what she had done to earn such disrespectful treatment;
while Barakah, beside the window, looking
out at Christian villages, was haunted by remembrance
and grew sad.</p>

<p>The sun had long been up when they reached
Paris. Yûsuf and Hâfiz, Bedr-ul-Budûr and Barakah,
packed in one cab, were driven with a rattle
through tumultuous streets to the hotel where
rooms had been engaged for them. The hostess, a
stout woman elegantly dressed in black, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a>[Pg 138]</span>
entire staff stood out to welcome them. The
woman bowed incessantly, addressing Yûsuf and
his friend as “Monseigneur.” Finding that Barakah
knew French she drew to her and poured a
smooth flow of amenities into her ear.</p>

<p>“Madame has only to command&mdash;all that she
desires. The nobility of the Orient are our most
valued clients. Should madame require conversation,
I am always at her service. The princes
come to Paris for diversion, that is understood.
Young men so rich! They must amuse themselves!
But then their ladies must not find the life too sad.”</p>

<p>Thus prattling, she conducted them upstairs and
flung open a door, exclaiming: “Voila!” Crossing
the landing to another door, she flung that open
also. “Voila!” she cried again. Bedr-ul-Budûr,
so tired that she could hardly drag her feet up,
chose the left-hand room, which happened to be
nearest. Yûsuf and Barakah proceeded to the
other. Both parties ordered coffee and some light
refreshment, and after breakfasting went straight
to bed. They rested until evening, when the men
went out to find their friends, whose lodging was
close by. They returned with sundry purchases,
hats, gloves, and scarves, which they declared they
needed for complete disguise.</p>

<p>On the next morning the whole party, in two
carriages, went out to smell the air and view the
city. It was a cloudless day and the streets
sparkled, the trees along the boulevards were like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a>[Pg 139]</span>
fat green posies. They were feeling happy when,
in an important thoroughfare, they discovered
people pointing at them, drivers shouting. Yûsuf
and his seat companion Hâfiz grew uncomfortable.
Cries of amazement reached them from the other
carriage. Their cabman turned round with a grin
and told them:</p>

<p>“‘Place aux dames,’ messieurs!&mdash;That is what
they cry. These ladies are not slaves with us, que
diable!”</p>

<p>The two men had been lounging in the roomy seat
which faced the horse. They at once resigned it,
addressing bows and smiles of deference to the
angry multitude; and called out to their friends
to do the like. But the incident destroyed their
pleasure in the drive; nor were the ladies happy in
the seat of honour, a gazing-stock for infidels who
might possess the evil eye.</p>

<p>“Saw one ever such fanaticism?” groaned
Yûsuf. “And they call this country free&mdash;a
place where every one does what he likes!”</p>

<p>That afternoon was spent in the hotel in a strange
manner; Barakah, at the demand of Yûsuf, instructing
the four men in foreign customs. They
posed and pirouetted in her salon, rehearsing
bows, the flourish of a hat, the proper compliments;
while the three girls looked on with saucer eyes.
After dinner they again appeared before her, this
time without their fezes, wearing hats which gave
to them a very villainous and sleek appearance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a>[Pg 140]</span>
Required to criticize their dress and bearing from a
Frankish standpoint, she suggested some improvements
which were hailed with gratitude. Yûsuf
returned home after midnight, tired but garrulous.
It seemed that they had lighted on a charming
Frenchman, who undertook to show them all the
sights. Next day the men rose late and then went
out together, leaving the women to their own
devices; returned to dinner, then went off again,
remaining out this time till nearly morning.</p>

<p>The programme did not vary on succeeding
days. The girls, deserted, clung to Barakah.
They wailed and prayed to God, and dreamed of
Cairo. At length one of them&mdash;it was Bedr-ul-Budûr&mdash;took
courage to reproach her lord; when
all four men were stricken with amazement.
They had thought the ladies would be gay indoors
without them, as they were at home. To cheer
them up, a trip to Versailles was arranged. It
passed off gaily, with less shyness than usually
appeared when they all mixed together. As they
strolled about the park, a youth named Izz-ud-dîn
made up to Barakah, and with the greatest diffidence
implored her to confide to him the secret
how to win the love of Frankish ladies. When she
smilingly assured him there was none, he cried:</p>

<p>“O Lord of Heaven! Then thou wilt not tell
it. They are so easy to their own men, as we
know from books; to us so difficult. It cannot
be fanaticism, since we seem as Franks.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a>[Pg 141]</span></p>

<p>“But what need hast thou of women, with a
pearl of beauty here beside thee?” questioned
Barakah.</p>

<p>“One who has beheld thy loveliness must
evermore desire the like of it! Oh, that thou
hadst a sister for me!” he made answer glibly.</p>

<p>He moved away, but presently another came
and made the same preposterous request, retreating
with the same forced compliment; and
on the journey home, when Yûsuf closed his eyes
and seemed to sleep, Hâfiz Bey, whom she had
thought more sensible, approached her in his
turn. When she denied all knowledge of the
matter he answered in low tones:</p>

<p>“There is a secret, that is known, by Allah.
Thou hast it, and hast given hints to Yûsuf;
else why should he be more successful than the
rest of us?”</p>

<p>“Because he is better looking,” it was on the
tip of her tongue to say, as she surveyed the fat,
good-tempered face of Hâfiz with its Chinese eyes.
It was all that she could do to keep from screams
of laughter.</p>

<p>“It is my dream,” he whispered. “By Allah
it disturbs my nights with cruel pain&mdash;to take a
lady just like thee in all respects&mdash;a Frank and
noble, of extreme refinement&mdash;back with me to
Masr.”</p>

<p>She derided him. He still continued pleading,
supporting his petition with the grossest flattery,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a>[Pg 142]</span>
till they reached home, when Yûsuf suddenly
sprang up and glowered at Hâfiz. He had been
feigning sleep. It was a thunderbolt. Bedr-ul-Budûr
screamed warning to her lord, who gave
but a single look and fled indoors, the jealous
one pursuing like a madman. In the hall the
harmless youth was overtaken and turned round
to plead. With a howl of “Dog!” Yûsuf sprang
at his throat and bore him to the ground. Like
dogs in very truth they fought till parted by the
hotel servants with the help of broomsticks;
while Barakah strove in vain to make her explanation
heard; Bedr-ul-Budûr appealed to Allah
and the prophet; and the landlady from the
third step of the stairs, with hands and eyes
thrown up, exclaimed repeatedly:
“O ciel! C’est monseigneur!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>


<p>Half an hour later Yûsuf and Hâfiz were in each
other’s arms, sighing gustily and rocking to and
fro in the ecstasy of reconciliation. Barakah
had explained things to her husband in the interim,
taking him to task severely for his savage conduct.
To be thought uncivilized had always been his
dread, and just then, with red eyes and all dishevelled,
a-quiver from the fray, he stood convicted.
With repentant tears he ran to ask forgiveness
of his late antagonist.</p>

<p>It was decided that they twain, with their respective
consorts, should spend the evening quietly
in Yûsuf’s room; in pursuance of which resolution
they had supped together, and Bedr-ul-Budûr, who
owned a lute, was going to sing, when a card was
brought to Hâfiz by the chamber-maid. He frowned
and clenched his teeth as he examined it.</p>

<p>“It is the Prince, my uncle!” he exclaimed.
“He has been told our whereabouts; it must be
by my father, since we have been careful not to
call on any of the Turks in Paris. O Calamity!
My uncle is correct and cold, a madman who
condemns all pleasure.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a>[Pg 144]</span></p>

<p>With haste he sent his concubine into her own
apartment, while Yûsuf hustled Barakah into the
dressing-room and locked the door. No would-be
Franks received the exiled Prince, but a pair of
ceremonious Orientals, with fezes carried at the
most respectful angle, who strove with one another
to be first to kiss his hand.</p>

<p>The Prince was a tremendous talker. A scion
of the ruling house of Egypt, enduring banishment
for his political opinions, he began upon the
state of that unhappy country for which he saw
no hope save in a European form of government.
He wished the young men to attend the
meetings of his club, “the Friends of Progress,”
at a café on the Boulevard des Italiens; and the
young men swore to do so on the first evening they
could spare from the study of French thought
and institutions which at present took up every
minute of their time.</p>

<p>From national affairs the Prince passed on to
household matters, advocating education for all
women and promotion to an equal rank with men.
At this his nephew cried:</p>

<p>“We think as you do, having each a lady whom
we treat precisely in the Frankish manner. Yûsuf
here present has espoused a noble Englishwoman,
who instructs us. Introduce her, Yûsuf, since my
uncle shares our views.”</p>

<p>Barakah expected her release, which she had
long desired, for the Prince’s voice was wonderfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a>[Pg 145]</span>
sweet and winning, and she burned with curiosity to
see his face. But the talk sheered off from her.
The Prince, resenting the intrusion of a concrete
instance on ideas, rebuked the young men sternly,
causing both to cringe.</p>

<p>“You mistake my meaning,” he informed them.
“God forbid that I should wish our ladies to
resemble closely those of Europe. If you desire
that, you are very foolish. The harîm life, or something
like it, is the best for women. It only needs
reform and elevation. It is a system founded on
the laws of God expressed in nature, whereas
the European way of treating women has no sanction.
The latter seems entirely meretricious when
one sees how ladies here make sport of marriage
and shun motherhood&mdash;how children flout and
override their parents. If the understanding of
our women were improved, their status raised, I
think our way would be acknowledged better by
impartial judges. No, all that I would borrow
from the Franks would be a weapon. They excel
us in mechanical contrivances, in practical education,
and in method. These gifts I covet, for with
equal weapons we should be their masters; our Faith
exceeding any motive power which they possess.”</p>

<p>He went on talking in this strain till nearly midnight,
when he left abruptly. Barakah was then
let out of her dark prison. Alone with Yûsuf, she
inquired his real opinion of the Prince’s views,
which seemed to her inspiring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a>[Pg 146]</span></p>

<p>“Like pitch! Like dung!” he answered in
the vulgar speech of Egypt. “The production of
ideas is an amusing pastime. It is strange, the
things a man can think of if he applies his mind
to it. And when a Prince is speaking one admires,
of course; though this one is a madman who has
lost a fine position and will lose his life merely for
love of argument. What we are and do belongs
to Allah. No thinking or wild talk affects it,
praise to Him!”</p>

<p>He seemed glad to change the subject. Putting
his arm round Barakah, he begged her in seductive
tones to confide to him the secret about Frankish
women.</p>

<p>“It is not for myself I ask,” he whispered
fondly; “but Hâfiz, Izz-ud-dîn, and Saïd die to
know. Where are these balls at which distinguished
women fling aside all shame? We
have been to dances, but the women there are base
and ribald, showing none of that refinement in
depravity which charms the mind in writings of this
country.”</p>

<p>In vain did she assure him that good Frankish
women were every whit as moral as good Orientals.</p>

<p>“We have their books for testimony,” was his
answer. And again he told her: “It is for my
friends I plead. I myself, as is well known, desire
thee only.”</p>

<p>The women were left more and more alone, the
private explorations of their lords bereaving them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a>[Pg 147]</span>
by day as well as night. Barakah did her best to
entertain them. Together with the landlady she
planned excursions, and took them to the ateliers
where modes are created. But the sense of desolation
dogged them everywhere. Scenes which they
might have viewed with pleasure had their lords
been faithful, encounters which might then have
given them a thrill of mischief, appeared heart-rending
in their luckless state. The very gaiety of
the Parisian streets seemed gruesome. If a man
in passing touched them they were seized with
trembling, and once or twice came very near to
fainting from pure shame; and their terror was intense
at passing unknown doorways, though the
landlady assured them there was not the slightest
danger.</p>

<p>Their haunting fear was lest male unbelievers
should abduct them; still more, perhaps, lest
they should come to wish for such a fate&mdash;the
most appalling that could be imagined for a
Muslim woman. Bedr-ul-Budûr declared she
knew a girl who, married to an infidel, brought
forth black beetles&mdash;“not one, but thousands!
millions!”&mdash;she related graphically&mdash;which at
length devoured her. Such stories were received
with acclamation, as justifying the extreme abhorrence
which they felt for Frenchmen. And
Barakah, though she tried to reason with them,
shared their feelings in some measure, dismayed
by the vulgarity of Western life. When, added<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a>[Pg 148]</span>
to all this, it rained for five days in succession,
her friends resigned their cause to God and ceased
to worry, while she herself grew thoroughly despondent.</p>

<p>The girls shrugged shoulders at the sinful folly
of their owners, now too far gone in dissipation to
endure reproaches.</p>

<p>“It is a malady, a madness,” said Bedr-ul-Budûr,
with resignation. “It is the air of infidelity
in this accursed city. We did wrong to travel unprovided
with the antidote, which must be known
to sages and obtainable. It is bad enough for us,
but what of Barakah&mdash;a chief wife, a great lady?
How can she endure it?”</p>

<p>Barakah did at last think fit to make a protest.
One night and early morning she sat up for Yûsuf,
and her reproaches met with a success which
startled her. He wept aloud and flung himself upon
the floor. His face was ghastly. When questioned,
he confessed that he had sinned most foully,
having that night consumed so much abomination
that on his way home he had been struck
down by God with awful sickness and had nearly
died. He swore that none but devils lived in Paris,
and implored her to transport him back to Egypt.</p>

<p>A picture seen the previous morning in a shop
upon the boulevard had roused in Barakah the wish
to visit Switzerland. She longed to walk by forest
streams, beneath great mountains, in solitude,
with keen, cool breezes to restore her spirits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a>[Pg 149]</span></p>

<p>“Paris is not the whole of Europe,” she informed
him gently. “There are scenes of famous beauty
which we ought to visit. Take me to Switzerland!”</p>

<p>“At once!” he cried. “This very day now
dawning! By Allah, I would go to Gebel Câf with
thee alone to get away from Paris.”</p>

<p>She bade him tell his friends to treat their women
better, which he swore to do; and directly after
breakfast took him out, while his resolve was eager,
to obtain money from the bank where he had credit,
and buy tickets to Geneva, the first name occurring
to her. She was glad that she had taken this precaution
when, later in the day, she saw his purpose
weaken. The tickets actually bought alone sustained
it, for he had the Oriental’s shrewd regard
for money’s worth. That night they spent in the
train, both cherishing sensations of deliverance,
though those of Barakah were chequered by the
vision of three weeping girls, who at the moment of
departure had embraced her knees and tried to
hold her.</p>

<p>Their Alpine tour, however, was of short duration.
Yûsuf was contented in Geneva, giving praise
to Allah for the vast supply of drinking water.
But when, at her suggestion, they moved on to
Chamounix, his feeling changed. His face went
green as on that night in Paris. His nostrils
and his eyes distended to their utmost, reminding
the observer of a frightened horse. The sight of
the great mountains closing in and hanging over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a>[Pg 150]</span>
him oppressed his soul with terror which was not
diminished by the occurrence in the hour of their
arrival of a dreadful thunderstorm. When he saw
the numbers of the visitors he gasped and questioned:
“Come these here for pleasure? Is it
possible? A place so frightful, so appalling, like
Gehennum! If one came with a large company,
with music and loud songs that never ceased, and
kept his eyes shut all the time, it might be bearable;
supposing one were forced to do it, for some
crime ... For pleasure, sayest thou? What
pleasure can they find?”</p>

<p>“They walk and climb the mountains. They
love Nature. And the air is excellent.”</p>

<p>“By Allah, wild beasts! Human beings are more
sensitive. How can they love Nature who approve
her in most horrid mood? It is evident that God
Most High designed such scenes for a warning and a
menace, to be shunned. Yet these applaud. They
are utterly devoid of feeling. May Our Lord destroy
them!”</p>

<p>A prey to panic, he no longer heard her arguments.
His one desire was to rejoin his friends as soon as
might be, to see once more the visage of a true
believer; and two days later they were back in
Paris.</p>

<p>Barakah’s return was hailed with rapture by
the hapless girls, who had not ventured out of doors
during her absence. Things, they declared, were
even worse than ere she left, their men more shame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a>[Pg 151]</span>less.
Yûsuf had sworn beforehand to discountenance
nocturnal outings, and for the first two days
he kept his word; though Hâfiz and the others
begged her to release him from it, protesting that
their occupations were most innocent. Indeed,
their childlike zest in evil-doing so resembled innocence
that she felt cruel when refusing, as if denying
babies some small pleasure. But on the third
day Yûsuf came to her, with worried frown, and
said:</p>

<p>“Hâfiz and the rest, I fear, are going much too
far. I feel responsible for them, since we are all one
party. They do not tell me all their pranks. I
have been thinking. It is my duty to be with them
and restrain their conduct.”</p>

<p>“Do what thou judgest right and God preserve
thee!” answered Barakah, with a point of irony
which he did not perceive.</p>

<p>“My conscience is relieved,” he cried. “I thank
thee. God knows how it has troubled me since
our return.”</p>

<p>That evening he departed with his friends, leaving
Barakah to hear the lamentations of the girls.</p>

<p>“They are all bewitched,” cried Bedr. “Hâfiz
is by nature pious. Even now he names the Name
of Allah when he opens any door and curses the
religion of the infidels when passing by their idols
in the streets and squares. Our Lord preserve his
life! Each night I see him dead in some disgraceful
haunt, his house dishonoured. Oh that I knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a>[Pg 152]</span>
a good magician, a true believer, in this land of
mangy dogs!”</p>

<p>Their fears, against her will, infected Barakah;
during the long night-watches they became a sickness,
and when day broke again they seemed confirmed.
Yûsuf had not returned. She went to
Bedr-ul-Budûr and found her in the same anxiety.
They sat together, wondering what to do. Grey
light at the window, raindrops coursing down the
panes, made anguish visible.</p>

<p>At length, when eight o’clock had struck, there
came a note for Barakah. It was in French, and
from the exiled Prince, the revolutionary. It bade
her have no fear; her husband would be with her
in an hour, when the writer hoped, with her permission,
to present his compliments in person and explain
the case. The other girls had come by that time from
their lodgings to get strength from Barakah. Conjecture
ravened round the simple statement in the
letter. At ten o’clock the Prince sent up his card;
the three girls fled across the passage just in time to
avoid encountering the visitor, who led into the room
the errant youths. The Prince, a lean, ascetic-looking
man, with boyish eyes, bowed low to Barakah.</p>

<p>“Madame,” he opened, with a flourish of his hand
towards the group of reprobates, “I ask you to remember
of your husband, and also beg you to remind
the fair companions of my nephew and these
other gentlemen, that they are young, these boys,
and therefore capable of progress. It is a proof<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a>[Pg 153]</span>
that they possess some germ of sense, which later
may develop into mind, that, being terrified at last,
they sent to me. I found them in a most equivocal
position&mdash;in fact, dear madame, at the Conciergerie.
Thanks to my relations with important
people in this city, I had no difficulty in procuring
their release, since they were not precisely guilty,
only imbecile. I am glad to have been able to
assist them, for the love I bear their parents and
our common Faith. But they will allow me to remark
that vicious boys should travel only with a
tutor, who should have a whip. It disgusts me even
to conceive that any man could be so foolish as
to quit the side of one so lovely and so virtuous as
you, madame, to follow beastliness. Dear madame,
your servant!”</p>

<p>He retired; when Yûsuf and the others pressed
round Barakah, a group of penitent and frightened
children. Hâfiz, the fat, knelt down before her,
tears coursing down his cheeks; Saïd kissed her
raiment; Yûsuf pleaded in her ear. They had
done wrong, they owned, though nothing very
dreadful. Some elegant ladies had admitted them
to their society; they were sitting in a café communing
in all refinement, when horrible low men
arrived and claimed those ladies. One threw a
glass at Saïd and cut his face&mdash;the wound was
shown&mdash;on which there was a scuffle; gendarmes
came and, siding with their co-religionists, conveyed
the righteous Muslims straight to prison.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a>[Pg 154]</span></p>

<p>“Where we should have stayed for ever, had
not Hâfiz thought of calling in his uncle,” blubbered
Izz-ud-dîn; “simply for being Muslims,
they are so fanatical.”</p>

<p>All four were bent upon return to Egypt, since
Paris had become a place of terror. The rapture
of the girls was indescribable. They danced and
clapped their hands, embraced each other, laughed,
cried, and gave way to all kinds of folly. Bedr-ul-Budûr
made vows to divers saints, and held
delighted conversations with her mother long
since dead.</p>

<p>Four days later they were all on board a steamer,
quitting France. The sea was smooth; the
ladies stayed on deck. There was no longer any
question of confining them in stuffy cabins;
experience of Frankish manners had done that
much good.</p>

<p>Yûsuf turned round from cursing the fair
country they were leaving, to look ahead across
the vast expanse of sparkling sea.</p>

<p>“O land of Egypt! Blessed one!” he sighed.
“Most beautiful of all that see the sun! In thee
are no hideous and shocking mountains, no cataracts,
no chasms, no ferocious beasts or savage
people such as appal the traveller in other lands.
All is flat and smooth and debonair in thee;
and if thou housest infidels they dare not bite.
Thy Nile is smooth and good to drink, not putrid
and for ever kicking like this sea. May Allah<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a>[Pg 155]</span>
bring us to thy shores in safety and never let us
leave them any more, but live in honour, eating,
drinking, fasting in due season, praising God,
doing good deeds, and getting many children!”</p>

<p>At this conclusion there was laughter and
applause.</p>

<p>“Amîn!” cried Hâfiz. “By Allah, it is true.
The air of lands of infidelity breeds madness.
Hail, O Egypt!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>


<p>“A rare place, by Allah!&mdash;full to the brim of
education and refinement. It is there that one
acquires the latest mode and learns to view all
creatures with fastidious eyes. In Paris people
would be angered at the ignorance which prevails
even among our greatest learned men. Thou too
shouldst go to Paris, O my dear!”</p>

<p>Thus Hâfiz Bey at Alexandria, to a relative who
came on board to welcome him. Barakah was
much amused to overhear him, as also Yûsuf
vaunting Paris to Ghandûr; who, weeping all the
time and sighing “Praise to Allah!” heard not
a word of what his lord was pleased to say. Great
was the joy of seeing Egypt once again. Even
for the girls, it wiped out all unpleasantness,
making a plaintive tone impossible.</p>

<p>Shrouded once more in habbarah and face-veil,
they stood and watched the crowd of buildings
faint with sunshine, seeming diaphanous between
the sapphire sky and a blue sea that looked opaque
as lapis lazuli. A gaily coloured people thronged
the quays and crossed the harbour in innumerable
little boats. A din as rousing as a clarion call,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a>[Pg 157]</span>
composed of many simple noises, filled the sunlight.
The girls, exhilarated, danced on tiptoe as
they waited for the word to go ashore. They
chattered like small birds, inconsequently, and
every minute interjected “Praise to Allah!”
Barakah inclined to silence, though she shared
their rapture.</p>

<p>The face-veil, which she had not worn for many
weeks, seemed strange at first. It gave the sense
of prying and slight mischief one has in peeping
over a forbidden wall. Her eyes above it seemed
more penetrating. She turned them from the
crowd on shore to follow Yûsuf’s movements.
He was now himself again, correct and dignified,
commanding as of right, entirely rehabilitated in
her good opinion. It seemed to her that the
contempt she had so lately felt for him was undeserved.
Sinking in a strange element, he had lost
his head and for a moment clung to her. The
case had been her own at first in Egypt. A
minute previous she had said good-bye to Hâfiz,
Izz-ud-dîn, and Saïd. It was curious to know
that though they would be dwelling near her in
the city, meeting Yûsuf daily, she would very
likely never see them in this world again. But
the prospect did not sadden her at all. Shade
and seclusion seemed just then the highest good.</p>

<p>Having spoken their polite farewells, Yûsuf
and his companions took no further notice of the
group of veiled ones. Ghandûr had been deputed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a>[Pg 158]</span>
to look after them. He ushered them on shore,
and sat beside the driver of the carriage which
conveyed them to the railway station, praising
Allah all the while and weeping tears of joy.
In Barakah’s absence, he declared repeatedly,
there had been no breeze in Egypt nor any spot
of shade for man’s repose. He found them their
reserved compartment in the train, and supplied
their many needs, procuring sweets, chickpease,
pistachio nuts, and hard-boiled eggs from venders
on the platform, as well as two large porous jars
of drinking-water. The girls asked Allah to take
note how good he was, and called him brother.</p>

<p>The dazzle and intoxication of great light remained
with them even when the door was shut
and they were in warm shade. The sunlight here
was not like that of Paris, a thing to stare at, but
a blinding glory. It danced in flakes of all the
colours of the rainbow, making the buildings and
the people pale and ghostlike. The very heat
which soon reigned in their moving box, the very
dust which drifted through its shutters, were
welcome, being heat and dust of Egypt; and at
the stations, when familiar cries were heard, the
speech of true believers built upon the name
of Allah, the girls could not contain their sentiments,
but bounced upon the seats and shrieked
for joy.</p>

<p>“Hear what I am going to do, by Allah’s leave,”
cried Bedr. “Immediately on my arrival at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a>[Pg 159]</span>
palace, before seeing any one, I shall go to the
hammâm and make our old bellânah scrub and
knead me till every vestige of the dust of Paris is
abolished. Then she shall dye my hands and feet
with henna and shall kohl my eyes and eyebrows,&mdash;if
we had not been forbidden to take kohl to Paris,
our men would not have left us as they did,&mdash;and
then I shall stretch myself like a sleek cat and looking
at my pretty hennaed toes, shall say, ‘I seek
refuge in Allah from the abomination of the infidels.’
That done, and being dressed in my most splendid
robes, I shall present myself before my ladies, and
shall lie to them; declaring that I was most happy
there in Paris, that Hâfiz Bey refused to leave me
for a single instant. The ladies will not doubt me,
seeing my great beauty, and Hâfiz Bey, you may
be sure, will not deny my story. Thus shall I gain
more favour in his eyes, and make his wife&mdash;the
proud one!&mdash;wish that she had gone instead of me.
What say you?”</p>

<p>“By Allah, we will do the same in all respects!”
her companions cried delightedly. “But what of
Barakah? Promise, O Barakah, to hide the truth
from the harîm!”</p>

<p>Barakah promised; when they made her swear
to love them always, though they were but slave-girls
and she a dignified and noble lady, for the sake
of the misfortunes they had borne together. They
all clung round her when the train reached Cairo.
The door of their compartment was flung open by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a>[Pg 160]</span>
Sawwâb in person, grinning welcome, with other
eunuchs close behind him on the platform.</p>

<p>Sawwâb conducted Barakah with honour to the
harîm carriage, entering which she was hugged
breathless by the lady Fitnah, while Leylah
Khânum and her daughters started chattering,
telling her all the news at once and in a single
breath.</p>

<p>Gulbeyzah had been married a whole month.
She was absent in the country with her lord’s whole
house, but would return, it was expected, in a week
or two. Had Barakah heard in Europe&mdash;no doubt
she had&mdash;that the Sea Canal was to be opened in
the coming year, with great festivities?&mdash;the King
and Queen of France were coming, it was rumoured.
Murjânah Khânum had been far from well. That
was why she had not come to welcome Barakah, to
whom she sent her warmest salutations. Barakah
was not going to the garden-house this time, but to
the Pasha’s palace, to remain with them, the praise
to Allah! Fitnah herself had seen the rooms
cleaned out and perfumed. One of the blacks,
Zamurrudah, was dead, the Lord have mercy on
her! The old striped cat had kittens, lucky one!
The Pasha’s nieces were quite positive about the
fact, though no one had been able to find out their
hiding-place.</p>

<p>As Barakah, caressed by all of them, received
this outpour, her feeling of home-coming was complete.
And when she came to her own gilded salon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a>[Pg 161]</span>&mdash;the
same where she had sipped the poison which
seemed now a dream&mdash;there was a slave-girl of
Murjânah Khânum’s waiting to conduct her to the
bath, with a present of rare flowers and fruit, and a
robe of honour which she was to don, when she had
rested, for supper in Murjânah Khânum’s rooms,
where all the ladies were invited to meet her.</p>

<p>The ladies, having voided their own news, desired
a full account of Paris and her doings. “In sh´Allah,
thou wast happy there!” they all exclaimed.
When she replied, “My happiness is
here with you,” the answer gave unbounded satisfaction.
From their remarks she learnt, to her no
small amazement, that Hâfiz Bey was the son of
her old friend Aminâh Khânum.</p>

<p>“Thou didst not know?” they cried. “How
can that be? And Bedr-ul-Budûr&mdash;surely thou
hast heard of her&mdash;the slave whose beauty the Princess
was always vaunting? It is very strange!”</p>

<p>The placid gossip and the shaded calm existence
were delightful after months of agitation. Barakah
fell into the harîm habits with enthusiasm, devouring
sweetstuff at all hours, enjoying cigarettes and
the narghileh. The best part of her morning
was spent at the bath, where the ladies met for
gossip and for healthful exercise; her afternoon in
seeing visitors or paying visits. Gulbeyzah came
to see her, radiating gladness, extolling not her husband
but her fellow-wives.</p>

<p>“We spend such merry days together,” she in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a>[Pg 162]</span>formed
her friend. “Oh, how much better than
to be an only wife!”</p>

<p>When Barakah returned the visit, she was received
by the four durrahs with one voice of welcome.
The four together formed a charming small
society, quite independent of the husband’s humours
and the outside world. All their possessions
they enjoyed in common, even children. Barakah
was begged to come and see them often, and to love
them all.</p>

<p>She would have been completely happy in those
days but for embarrassment arising from a secret
which she longed yet feared to tell. She was with
child. Suspicion grew to certainty and still she put
off the announcement, dreading the outcry of these
candid women and the harîm ceremonies. It
slipped from her by accident, one afternoon, and
the fuss they made proved even worse than
expectation.</p>

<p>Amînah Khânum brought Bedr-ul-Budûr to see
her, saying:</p>

<p>“This girl of mine has news to tell you.”</p>

<p>The old Princess herself proclaimed the news with
praise to Allah. A flush suffused the listener from
head to foot.</p>

<p>“I too&mdash;&mdash;” she murmured, and then stopped
in great confusion. Amînah Khânum pounced on
her with eager questions. Bedr-ul-Budûr knelt
down before her in an ecstasy.</p>

<p>“Thou, too, art blest? And thou hast kept it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a>[Pg 163]</span>
secret all this while?” the Princess cried. “O
Bedr, go and beg the lady Fitnah to come hither
instantly!”</p>

<p>“No, no!” entreated Barakah, distraught with
shame.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes!” replied the other, scoffing at her.
“Is this the famed false modesty of England?
Praise God Most High that thou art fruitful,
praise Him loudly!”</p>

<p>The joy of Fitnah Khânum passed all bounds.
She sent a messenger at once to Yûsuf, another
to the Pasha, with the tidings. The Pasha came
at once to pay his compliments to Barakah.
Yûsuf came later, having thought it necessary to
circulate the happy news among his friends.
Ghandûr, who, as the water-carrier of the apartment,
sat always in the alley, underneath the
lady’s lattice, was heard intoning a loud song of
triumph, three parts prayer, of which each verse
concluded with: “Twin boys, in sh´Allah!”</p>

<p>Joy-shrieks resounded; the whole household
smiled; her friends thronged round her, informed
of her good luck as if by miracle, for black-shrouded
newsbearers were ever flitting by
shadowed walls, along the edge of crowded markets,
linking the great harîms in one society, and what
was done in one was known in all. And Barakah
alone saw any call for shame or reticence.</p>

<p>From that day forth she was the idol of her
little world, her every want forestalled by warm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a>[Pg 164]</span>
solicitude. Murjânah Khânum talked to her in
a religious strain; Fitnah, more homely, prepared
dainties for her; the Pasha’s sister came and told
her stories. The very children talked aloud of her
condition, and hailed it as a blessing to the house.</p>

<p>She had a good excuse for shunning the festivities
which took place on the arrival of the
Emperor of the French in Cairo; though her
husband was employed in the reception, and all
the ladies were agog to see the Empress. She
wished to be entirely Oriental. Frankish talk
disgusted her. Any reminder that the Europeans
still existed was annoying; how much more to
hear them vaunted by her Eastern friends. Yûsuf
himself made fun of her fanaticism. The women
humoured her conceit with knowing smiles.</p>

<p>Gulbeyzah and Bedr-ul-Budûr, both in the
same condition, were her constant visitors. Amînah
Khânum gave advice in her brusque way, and
as the Englishwoman’s time drew near, did more
for her protection than she knew of in her illness;
impressing on Muhammad Pasha through Murjânah
the necessity of calling in a Frankish doctor,
and herself procuring from the Mufti the religious
judgment which stilled the angry outcry of the
harîm midwives.</p>

<p>The hour of trial came at length&mdash;an anguish
worse than death, succeeded by a happiness as
calm as heaven. From the cries of jubilation
filling all the house, from the blessings showered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a>[Pg 165]</span>
on her within the chamber, she knew that she
had borne a son. She saw the blue of evening
at the lattice, heard the murmur of the tired
city like a voice of waters, and, lulled by vast
contentment, fell asleep.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>


<p>Never in her life had Barakah seen so many
strange old women. There were always four or
five of them within her chamber, squatting on
mats along the wall, conversing in low tones,
ready at a breath to rearrange her pillows, or
fetch some posset that was ordered for her. They
were all of apelike ugliness, and, going barefoot,
moved as noiselessly as ghosts.</p>

<p>The Frankish doctor&mdash;an Italian&mdash;had pronounced
her much too frail to nurse her baby&mdash;a
decision which excited such dependants of the
house as were eligible for the post of foster-mother.
This was a great prize, kinship by milk, among
the Muslims, being esteemed as genuine and
binding as by blood. The wet-nurse thus became
a near relation of the family, and all her race had
claims upon its bounty. Barakah felt jealous of
the woman who usurped her function, till she
heard from Fitnah Khânum that the choice had
fallen on the wife of her old friend Ghandûr.
The girl, a former slave of the harîm, was then
presented to her, the baby in her arms; and won
her heart by her excessive gratitude. She was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a>[Pg 167]</span>
touched, too, by the transports of Ghandûr, who
sang thanksgiving to her lattice in his simple way.
His chant was something in this manner:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The sun is in my eyes! O happy day!<!--verse--></div>
<div class="verse">I grope as one half-blind. Behold the bounty of my lord!<!--verse--></div>
<div class="verse">I, the poor slave of Allah,<!--verse--></div>
<div class="verse">Am now the father of his son Abdallah,<!--verse--></div>
<div class="verse">My wife the mother of his son, by leave of Allah,<!--verse--></div>
<div class="verse">My little boy the brother of a child most blest, in sh´Allah!<!--verse--></div>
<div class="verse">The gracious consort of my lord, istaghfar Allah!<!--verse--></div>
<div class="verse">Has granted to our lowliness a share in her good gift from Allah.<!--verse--></div>
<div class="verse">May Allah bless my lord and lady in their noble offspring, and
preserve his life to be the luminary of our future days.”<!--verse--></div>
<!--stanza--></div><!--poem--></div><!--poetry-container--></div>

<p>She liked to hear him, his voice so near at hand
produced a sense of true devotion and security.
Missing his chant upon the following day, she
inquired what had become of him. She was informed
that, consequent upon his wife’s preferment,
he had been appointed to a small position
in the Government. It made her sad.</p>

<p>Her son was given over to the harîm midwives
to fulfil no end of ceremonies destined to frustrate
the powers of evil. For a week he was not left
alone or in the dark a single second. They carried
him in a procession through the house, his future
kingdom, and as each door was opened, sprinkled
salt mixed with the seven seeds to exorcize the
jinn who lurked within. Soon after birth his face
had been defiled with certain powders, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a>[Pg 168]</span>
Barakah could not persuade the women to wash
off. It was a necessary precaution, they assured
her, against jealous powers of darkness who, if
they had an inkling of his beauty, would destroy
him. Chief among these was the discarded wife
of Adam, alluded to as El Carînah (the companion),
the cause of man’s first fall, who hates Eve’s
daughters and resents their great fertility. Where
a child seems lovely and the mother shows delight
in its appearance, she attacks them both; if, on
the contrary, she sees it ugly and hears words
of disappointment, she lets it live to spite the
seed of Adam. For one so powerful, she must
be very stupid to be taken in by such pretences,
Barakah remarked; but they cried out that such
was not the case, but Allah in His mercy had set
limits to her sight and hearing. Each day the
infant was the central figure in some ancient rite
believed essential to its welfare.</p>

<p>As Barakah lay in bed and watched the pattern
of the lattice, her whole existence passing like a
dream before her, she sought to reconcile her
former English with her present Eastern life.
Her son was a fine boy, they all assured her. It
saddened her that she had no relations of her own
to take a pride in him. In this mood she asked
Yûsuf to write a little note to Mrs. Cameron entreating
her to come one day and see the baby.
He did so, and the answer was that she would
come with pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a>[Pg 169]</span></p>

<p>Elated by the prospect of this visit, Barakah
wished to have her offspring made presentable;
but when she gave command to wash his face and
wrap him in nice clothes, the goodies screamed
aloud, and fetched the lady Fitnah to remonstrate
with her. She gave way, perforce; and Mrs.
Cameron beheld the infant at his worst.</p>

<p>The visitor was very kind in her address to
Barakah; but, when she held the baby for a
minute, looking down at it, the latter, watching
keenly, saw upon her face a quiver of extreme
disfavour mixed with pity. The whiteness of
her hands and face showed the child yellow;
Barakah had thought him white as snow till then.
A flush of anger and humiliation reached her brain.</p>

<p>“His face is dirty, the poor little one! Our
Lord preserve him!” the visitor remarked in
Arabic as she returned the baby to his nurse;
at which there was an outburst of applause from
the onlookers. They called down blessings on the
lady’s head, desiring she might have herself a
thousand children, not like this one, puny and unpleasant,
but most beautiful.</p>

<p>Barakah, consumed with rage, murmured
hoarsely in response to Mrs. Cameron’s farewell.
The moment she was gone she burst out weeping.</p>

<p>“She did not like the child! She scorned
my son, because he is not altogether white as
she is.”</p>

<p>“Thou mistakest, O my dear! Be comforted!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a>[Pg 170]</span>”
cried Fitnah Khânum, while the other women
round her exchanged pitying glances.</p>

<p>“Thou art not yet perfect in our prudent
customs; but thy friend, though not a Muslimah,
has learnt them, having been much longer in the
land. Hast thou forgotten my instructions touching
El Carînah? Nor is she alone to be redoubted,
since Allah Himself abhors a boastful spirit, and
dishonours those who make too much of any
creature....”</p>

<p>“O Lord! I know all that!” wailed Barakah.
“But she disliked my child, despised him! I&mdash;I
saw it!”</p>

<p>Conviction that the portion of the human race
from which she sprang beheld her son as little
better than a monkey, tortured Barakah. She
had looked upon him as a mediator, but now
sought revenge. Hot, feverish dreams of hate
disturbed her rest; and when a spell of khamsîn
weather robbed the world of energy she grew as
weak and fretful as her thoughts were wild.</p>

<p>Already Barakah had kept her bed a fortnight
longer than any Eastern woman would have
dreamt of doing after childbirth. The lady
Fitnah, seeing she did not gain strength, believed
that some debilitating vile afrît was in her. The
Frankish doctor said there was no cause for fear.
She called him fool and worse, in her own circle;
since by his disregard or ignorance of pious formulas
he had left the door ajar for evil spirits. Resolved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a>[Pg 171]</span>
to stop the mischief, when no man was by she hung
a plant of garlic in the room, burnt potent odours
till its air grew suffocating, and dosed the patient
with a paste compounded of the dust of mummies
mixed with human milk. When these means
failed to drive away the enemy, she sat down in
despair among her cronies, and braced herself
to try the last resort of all.</p>

<p>This was the “zâr”&mdash;a very awful ceremony, of
which she was exceedingly afraid. Her wish to
hold it in the house&mdash;risking the Pasha’s favour,
and her life through terror&mdash;was proof of her
devoted love for Barakah. The dear one must be
healed at any price.</p>

<p>Accordingly, she summoned negresses of those
who hold familiar intercourse with demons, bought
a kid and several fowls alive, and made arrangements
to secure the sick-room to herself and her
confederates for two good hours upon a certain
afternoon.</p>

<p>Barakah was roused out of a troubled sleep by
women moving out the furniture from both bedchamber
and salon, and covering the floor with
worn-out linen and the cheapest matting. They
went, and she lay wondering, when Fitnah Khânum
came and bade her have no fear. The ceremony
she was going to witness was a potent medicine,
well calculated to restore her health completely.
Many servants, female children, and familiars of
the household trooped in with noiseless feet and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a>[Pg 172]</span>
squatted down along the wall. Then came a
group of half a dozen negresses, fantastically
dressed in rags of finery, with ringing anklets;
one of whom embraced a struggling little goat,
while the others bore live chickens by the feet.
Bold-eyed and with a swaggering gait, they
marched up to the bed, and seemed to offer up
the fowls and kid to Barakah, who could not
understand the words they uttered in a screeching
chant. They then danced back to the adjoining
room, of which the door stood open. Upon the
threshold madness seemed to seize them. They
fell upon the kid with cries of glee. The creature,
bleating piteously, was flung into an earthen bowl
placed there in readiness. Amid mad laughter
knives were brandished and brought down, hands
helping to extract the creature’s life. The fowls
were likewise gashed and torn asunder; the matting
round grew foul with steaming entrails. Another
minute and the slayers reappeared, their black
arms purpled to the elbow, dripping blood, their
faces and their lips defiled with it; and then began
a devilish dance of self-abandonment, all the more
horrible for its approach to beauty. The sleek
skin of the dancers caught blue lights; their fixed
eyes gleamed enormous, like those painted on
the lids of mummies. Barakah believed herself
in hell, for ever lost; it was as if an iron hand
compressed her throat. Her heart beat wildly.
One of the women, the most shameless, lurched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a>[Pg 173]</span>
towards her, stretching out a blood-stained hand.
Her heart gave one tremendous beat and then
stood still.</p>

<p>When she recovered consciousness it was to
find the lady Fitnah bending over her. The
negresses had gone, the room was cleansed, the
furniture replaced exactly as before. She might
have thought she had been dreaming had not
Yûsuf’s mother whispered eagerly:</p>

<p>“Breathe not a word to Yûsuf or our lord the
Pasha. Deny by Allah that thou sawest anything.
If not, the afrît which we have with pains extracted
will return and kill thee.”</p>

<p>In her weak state of mind, oppressed with
dreadful and disgusting images, Barakah believed
the words and shuddered. She was ill for weeks.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>


<p>During the heat of summer, part of the harîm,
consisting of the ladies Barakah and Fitnah, with
their children and attendants, stayed at a farm
belonging to the Pasha, on the banks of the Nile,
near Benha. The journey thither was performed
on donkeys in a long procession with a eunuch at
its head and tail, a eunuch boy leading the donkey
of each lady, that she might have freedom to hold
up her sunshade and munch nuts and sweetstuff.
The slave-girls, some of them, rode two together;
they waxed hilarious, exchanging jests with all
who passed them on the dyke. Their going raised
a goodly cloud of dust. The house to which they
went was large and formal, none too clean, though
very sparsely furnished. Behind it was a filthy
yard hemmed in by hovels, where dwelt the fellâhîn
who worked the farm. Before it was a garden of
fruit trees, and beyond that a plantation of young
date-palms. There was also a big tree beside a
water-wheel, where the ladies took their pleasure
in the shade. The land was absolutely flat in all
directions, but diversified in hue by divers crops,
broken here and there by clumps of trees and squat
mud villages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a>[Pg 175]</span></p>

<p>Here manners were relaxed; for all the peasant
women went unveiled, and their example made
the slaves less strict than in the city. The lady
Fitnah, being of the country, took delight in talking
with the villagers, both men and women, and
thus, though most correct in her apparel, set the
fashion of unbending. Yûsuf, who had now a
Government appointment, and the Pasha came to
see them when they had the leisure; and Ghandûr
also travelled down to see his wife.</p>

<p>To please the lady Fitnah, Barakah gave French
and English lessons to the children in the mornings
under the great tree, when many of the servants
also gathered round and tried to learn. She was
begged to be particularly strict with Hamdi, whom
the lady Fitnah seemed to think the soul of wickedness,
as indeed did everybody else, making his life
a burden with perpetual scolding.</p>

<p>This boy, her husband’s younger brother, was
attached to Barakah as the only one who never
shook him by the neck or cursed him. He told
her all his woes, and brought her offerings of
curious things he found in his illicit rambles. He
was always straying, though with no worse object,
he asserted, than the wish to be alone. His lady
mother called him “stupid Turk,” vowing that he
was all his father’s child, and she herself had neither
part nor lot in him; though Hamdi was the true
Egyptian adolescent, still but half awake, a slave
to every breeze, to every odour, and fascinated by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a>[Pg 176]</span>
the sight of gleaming objects. He would sit still
for hours in contemplation of a sunlit blade of grass;
at other times he would walk miles, drawn on invisibly,
with great brown eyes which seemed to
harbour visions. Barakah found him gentle and
obedient. In truth, his only wickedness that she
could see consisted in resentment of shrill interruptions.
At such times he would battle blindly
with assailants, cursing them, and crying out, in his
despair:</p>

<p>“Am I not a man full-grown? Do I not sleep in
the selamlik? Then let me be, or it shall be the
worse for you, by Allah!”</p>

<p>“A man full-grown, thou sayest?” screamed
the lady Fitnah one evening when he came home
soaked in mud from head to foot. “Listen, O
child of dogs, O malefactor! Knowest thou what
I shall do on our return to town? I shall marry
thee at once to Na’imah, thy uncle’s child. Thy
clothes are in a filthy state, thy tassel gone. Thou
hast been sprawling in some ditch, O piggish boy!
By the Prophet, I shall do as I have said. Sure,
matrimony is the only cure for one like thee. Thou
shalt wed Na’imah.”</p>

<p>“Allah forbid!” exclaimed the lad with fervour;
whereat the ladies and the servants burst out
laughing; for Na’imah, Leylah Khânum’s youngest
daughter, had been Hamdi’s chief tormentor there
at home, disturbing his still dreams with impish
glee, and quick to vanish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a>[Pg 177]</span></p>

<p>“Is it not cruel thus to hound me?” the unlucky
boy asked Barakah. “I do no wrong; they interfere
with me. And now my mother threatens
to unite me to the most hateful daughter of a dog
that ever yelped and bit.”</p>

<p>The month of Ramadan came on them in their
country life; and the long hours of heat without
a bite or sup made everybody irritable except
Barakah and the wife of Ghandûr, who were both
exempt from fasting&mdash;the former as an invalid, the
latter as a nursing-mother. The slave-girls lost
their usual delight in birds and greenery. A gun
fired in the distant market-town announced the
moment of release in the first bloom of night; but
the party failed to hear it sometimes, and looked
out for the lighting of the lamps around a village
mosque across the plain. At once arose vast sighs
of praise to Allah; cigarettes, prepared in readiness,
were seized and lighted; water was handed round
and food set out.</p>

<p>It was at that blest hour upon a certain evening
of the sacred month that a rapturous surprise
befell the party. A little cavalcade was seen
approaching on the dyke. It consisted of two
donkeys and a baggage mule. A woman sat upon
the foremost donkey; on the second rode two
children, boy and girl; while the mule was led by
a black-bearded, turbaned man of noble presence.
The ladies, sitting in the garden, peered, then
shouted:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a>[Pg 178]</span></p>

<p>“Tâhir! It is Tâhir! Tâhir, the great singer!
O most blessed day! Enter, O son of honour!
Deign to favour us!”</p>

<p>Learning that the master of the house was absent,
Tâhir would not enter, but sought a lodging in the
hovels of the fellâhîn, whither a rich meal was sent
to him. But after supper he came up into the
garden with his lute, followed timidly by all the
population of the hamlet; and his wife and children
stole into the room where all the women sat
with windows open, looking forward to the concert.
Once more his little daughter drew to Barakah,
and, having kissed her hand, sat down and
leaned against her. “I love thee,” she explained,
with a soft look; and then with a wide yawn exclaimed:
“I am so tired!” Barakah put her
arm about her, and the child seemed happy. She
did not go to sleep this time, however, but lay still,
fondling her protector’s hand, and gazing up at the
great stars.</p>

<p>“See, what a man he is!” exclaimed the Galla
slave, Fatûmah, her hand upon the shoulder of
her mistress, all respect forgotten in intense
excitement. “He does not even stay to tune
his lute. All that is for the common singers.
He is much above it. By Allah, he would sing
to a dog’s howl and make it musical.”</p>

<p>One twang of the lute, and then the magic voice
arose from out the shadow of the trees. It gave
a living spirit to the starlight, a soul to all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a>[Pg 179]</span>
nights that ever were or would be. It seemed
illumination, yet was all of mystery; it gave the
listener a sense of floating disembodied.</p>

<p>Once when Tâhir paused to rest, the voice of
Hamdi was heard in the garden, begging for leave
to hold his lute and play it.</p>

<p>“That boy again! Cut short his life!” cried
Fitnah Khânum. “Devoid of manners as of
sensibility. Remove him quickly!”</p>

<p>But Tâhir answered pleasantly: “Here, O my
son! Take it and play for me. Observe the
measure. Strike loudly in the pauses, softly
while I sing.” And Fatûmah, quite beside herself,
exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Behold the man he is! He can dispense with
all things. That which would ruin the performance
of another singer is a joy to him.”</p>

<p>Hamdi acquitted himself fairly well of the task
of accompaniment and won a word of praise
from Tâhir, which so moved him that when the
singer was departing the next morning early, he
stole out to him, and, looking round to ascertain
that he was heard of none save Barakah, entreated:</p>

<p>“Take me with thee, O my uncle. Instruct
me, let me play for thee for ever. This girl, thy
daughter, this little sugar-plum, shall be my bride.
Then we can all live happily together.”</p>

<p>“The honour is too high for us, O my small
lord!” the singer answered, with his charming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a>[Pg 180]</span>
smile. “Thy lot in life is better far, in sh´Allah,
than that of us poor players.”</p>

<p>“But they say that thou canst earn a hundred
pounds a night.”</p>

<p>“Seldom as much as that, beloved. And my
living is at Allah’s pleasure. It is a gift from
Him, to whom be praise. Come to me four years
hence, and we will think about it.”</p>

<p>With a dignified salute he started off; the
children, on their donkey, waved their hands and
screamed farewell. Hamdi was left standing disappointed
and a trifle injured.</p>

<p>“O my misfortune!” he exclaimed to Barakah.
“I would have given my right hand to go with
him. Like that I could escape from persecution
and accursed Na’imah, and dwell for ever in the
sound of music which transports my soul. Allah
is greatest!”</p>

<p>And he heaved a mighty sigh.</p>

<p>When the month of fasting ended, there were
mild rejoicings. The fellâhîn fired guns and let
off fireworks. The women smoked too much and
over-ate themselves, and felt aggrieved at being
far from Cairo, where the means of satisfaction
were more varied and abundant.</p>

<p>Then Yûsuf and the Pasha came and stayed a
week; delighted, coming fresh to it, with the
unoccupied existence over which the others had
begun to yawn. At the end of the week they all
returned to Cairo, the procession of the ladies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a>[Pg 181]</span>
keeping half a mile behind their lords. The first
view of the citadel on one hand, the pyramids of
Gîzah on the other, called forth thankful shouts.
The coloured, noisy streets, the odours sweet and
foul, the atmosphere of teeming life, excited
Barakah. She joined in exclamations of delight.</p>

<p>While she gazed with strange eyes at her gilded
salon, superintending the disposal of her baggage,
a letter was presented to her by Fatûmah. It
had been given to the latter that same minute
by Sawwâb the eunuch, who had had it in safe
keeping for two months. It was from Mrs.
Cameron.</p>

<p>Barakah, frowning, opened it and read:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“It grieves me much to learn that you have
been seriously ill. I heard of this quite by accident
from Doctor Torranelli, whom I chanced to meet
at a friend’s house. In some anxiety, I tried to
call upon you yesterday, but learnt that you are
absent in the country. I trust that the dear baby
flourishes. He must be a great comfort and delight
to you. Please never forget that I am your
sincere friend.”</p></blockquote>

<p>With an exclamation of annoyance, she tore up
the note.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<!--chap--></div>
<div class="chap">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a>[Pg 182]</span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h2>


<p>The idea of seeing Mrs. Cameron again was quite
intolerable. She therefore wrote that lady a brief
note, an asp for venom, designed to terminate acquaintance
and to rankle, and plunged into the
harîm pleasures with sensations of defiance.</p>

<p>One morning, as she lounged upon her cushioned
window-seat, smoking her narghileh and listening
to the voices wafted with the sunlight through
her lattice, Fatûmah came and with a grin announced
that Hamdi Bey desired an audience of
her Honour. She gave the word, and in came
Hamdi, knuckling his two eyes.</p>

<p>“O day of pitch!” he cried. “O vile nefarious
day! O my beloved sister, hide me, save me!
My father has enforced my mother’s harsh command.
I am to be married to-day to that unholy
child of dogs&mdash;against my will. I wished to
wait a thousand years. Ghandûr is waiting at this
minute to conduct me to the bath.”</p>

<p>As if in confirmation of his words, the voice of
Ghandûr shouted in the street without: “Make
haste, O Hamdi! Lo, the sun is high! The
shadow is already on the stone thou fixedst for
a limit when I let thee enter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a>[Pg 183]</span></p>

<p>“Thou hearest,” snuffled Hamdi, “how they
hound me? He has my wedding garments in a
bundle&mdash;O my hatred! Guests have been bidden&mdash;may
their fathers perish! Go to my mother
(she will hear thee); plead that I may be allowed
a few months’ respite. It is Na’imah who, through
her mother, hastens on the match. She would
destroy my new-found freedom and torment me.”</p>

<p>Barakah could not help laughing, though she
uttered words of comfort. Na’imah was a very
pretty girl, she pointed out, and not ill-natured,
though a great coquette. He would have none
of it, but shook his head with ominous frowns.</p>

<p>“I hate her!” he declared. “And knowest
thou? I have a mind to drown myself this
morning at the bath.”</p>

<p>Then, as Ghandûr’s calls became insistent, he
left the room with slow, reluctant steps.</p>

<p>The wedding was a small affair, the parties being
children of one house, and their betrothal (which
is legal marriage) having taken place in infancy.
The bride, enthroned, showed none of the reluctance
felt by Hamdi. A bright-eyed and determined
little maiden, she was wreathed in smiles;
and when Barakah inquired if she were truly happy,
replied, “The praise to Allah!” with decision.</p>

<p>Next day the house was full of smothered
laughter. Hamdi was completely changed. He
and his bride were now the fondest pair. The
lady Fitnah, who had always held that matrimony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a>[Pg 184]</span>
was a panacea for the crotchets of young people,
male and female, rendered praise where praise was
due. For many days, through shame, the bridegroom
hid from Barakah, and from every one else
to whom he had proclaimed his dread of marriage.</p>

<p>When she told Gulbeyzah of the case as of a
kind of miracle, the Circassian answered:</p>

<p>“I perceive no cause for wonder. The bridegroom
had not thought of her before in that relation,
had not truly known her&mdash;that is all. Love
is a blessing that brings gratitude as surely as
the Nile makes plants to grow.”</p>

<p>Gulbeyzah and Bedr-ul-Budûr&mdash;nay, all her
friends&mdash;viewed love, apart from any individual
man, as a material boon. Bred up to it and
ripened for it cunningly, they were ready to adore
the man who gave it, however unattractive from
a European standpoint. This view of love, when
realized, explained to Barakah the happiness
which every girl of her acquaintance seemed to
find in marriage, even where, as in Gulbeyzah’s
case, the husband was a greybeard thrice her age.
Those who possessed it were content and virtuous.
In those who had it not, or were deprived of it, all
amorous crime was reckoned pardonable.</p>

<p>Gulbeyzah and Bedr-ul-Budûr explained all this
to Barakah in thrilling tones, as if they uttered
truths divine.</p>

<p>“Behold the wisdom of our Faith,” they said,
“which grants to every woman this delight in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a>[Pg 185]</span>
secret. Women can never truly be the friends of
men; their soul is different. If thrown with men
for long, they feel fatigue. They ask of men one
thing&mdash;the gift of love. Here we consort with
women, true companions, all day long; and in the
night the bridegroom comes, and we are blest. Is
not this better than the way of Europe, which
sets at nought apparent truths&mdash;as that most men
love more than one of us, whereas most women
need but love itself, the hope of children?”</p>

<p>That was one of the occasions when Barakah
would have given anything to have an Englishwoman
present, and to watch her face. Another
came a few days later when she called upon
Gulbeyzah. Alighting from her carriage at the
palace door, she saw a baby’s coffin being carried
out, and thought at once of turning home again.
But already smiling eunuchs stood before her
bidding welcome, beseeching her to deign to follow
them to the haramlik. Gulbeyzah met her with
a kiss on either cheek.</p>

<p>“Come, help us to console Nasîbah,” she exclaimed.
“Her baby died this night. She is
distracted.”</p>

<p>She drew her friend into a chamber where the
childless mother lay, face downward, moaning,
while the others tried to soothe her.</p>

<p>“It is no matter,” was the burden of their consolations.
“It is not as if thou wert left altogether
desolate. Are we not one, we four? Thou hast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a>[Pg 186]</span>
two children left, since ours are thine, and in a day
or two Gulbeyzah will present thee with a third,
in sh´Allah!”</p>

<p>“In sh´Allah!” cried Gulbeyzah. “And it
shall be thine entirely. Directly it is born it shall
be sent to thee to nurse. I will forget it. And
when it is thy turn again, thou wilt repay me.
Is not that a good idea?”</p>

<p>Oh that English people, who regard polygamy
as something dreadful, could have witnessed that
small scene! The wish, escaping Barakah at unawares,
begot a heartache, as she realized that all
she saw and heard for their instruction was thwarted
of its natural vent for evermore.</p>

<p>She told herself that she was happy in this life;
and so she was upon the surface, where she kept
her thoughts, not daring to pry down into the
depths. In the early days she had desired more
knowledge of the Muslim faith, and a woman
learned in religion had been hired to teach her.
But the fury of that faith, the scathing nature of
its truths, appalled her, awaking recollections of
a creed more sentimental, with distressing doubts.
She very soon gave up her lessons, closed the eyes
of her intelligence, and resolutely sought her
pleasure in the passing hour.</p>

<p>Still there were moments when vague fears
oppressed her. When, in the third year of her
marriage, she brought forth a still-born child,
frightful abysses seemed to yawn around her, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a>[Pg 187]</span>
for days she was afflicted with a kind of nightmare
of misgiving, derived from recollection of the “zâr”
and other horrors.</p>

<p>The Eastern ladies were so calm and strong
compared with her; they flinched at nothing
except impropriety. The slaughter of a thousand
sheep at Curban Bairam, turning the kitchen court
into a shambles, caused them no disgust. It was
ordained of God, they told her, and it fed the poor.
They had no horror of disease or death or filthy
persons, and, though most cleanly, looked on
vermin philosophically. The Turks and the
Circassians, with their grand ideals, appeared more
dreadful than the Africans, whose faith was childlike.
Barakah preferred the latter. Her pleasure
was in feasts and little outings, in story-tellers,
dancers, and musicians who beguile the time; her
only rapture was in adoration of her small Muhammad.</p>

<p>Her hidden yearnings and beliefs clung round
the boy. She dwelt in longing for the days when
he should be her friend. He was her hope, the
product of both parts of her divided life; giving it
sense and sequence, and, in the end perhaps, if
Allah willed, consistency. She dreamt of a great
future for him, to astonish Europe. But in the
meanwhile, being sometimes dull, she felt the need
of an intelligent, discreet companion.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII</h2>


<p>On the recurrence of certain anniversaries, at the
two Bairams and in the month of Ragab, all Muslim
Cairo left the city of the living for the cities of the
dead adjoining it upon the east and south. Mothers
of sorrow like Murjânah Khânum, whose heart
was with her children in the grave, inhabited the
mausoleums for a week or more; but the majority
performed a one-day visit.</p>

<p>Blue night alive with stars was at her lattice
when Barakah was softly roused by her attendants
and arrayed in proper garb. She found Leylah
Khânum and her daughters waiting for her by the
mabeyn screen, where the eunuch had a heap of
roses and of henna-flowers to give them, as well
as branches of palm and sweet basil. With these
they made their way out to the carriage.</p>

<p>The principal streets were thronged with people
going in the same direction: men in clean robes,
who yawned, still half asleep; women, black-shrouded,
bearing palm-branches, with trays of
eatables upon their heads; small girls in tinselled
gauze of divers colours, and boys in stiff new
clothing&mdash;all with earnest faces, pressing out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a>[Pg 189]</span>
towards the cemeteries. Barakah kept peeping
through the shutter at the solemn crowd, to which
the fitful gleam of swinging lanterns added weirdness.
The concourse gave forth a dull clatter, above
which was heard the rumble of the carriage wheels
upon the stones, the shouts the coachman raised to
clear a way. Then suddenly all noise of going ceased,
although their wheels still rolled and the besetting
throng was even denser than before. They were
on sand. The people murmured like a shell. The
desert hill rose imminent against the stars. On
all sides spread a wilderness of humble graves, each
with its family group encamped beside the headstone.
Then came a steep incline, up which the
horses struggled under whip and cursing; and lo!
they were once more in city streets. On every
hand rose shadowy buildings, domes, and minarets.
A swarm of beggars went from door to door with
sacks and trays collecting doles of food.</p>

<p>Alighting at the gate of a large mosque-like
building, Barakah and her companions were conducted
through a courtyard to the women’s
quarters. Fitnah and Murjânah, who had spent
the night there with attendants, made them
welcome; after which they paid a visit to the
mausoleum proper, or the women’s side of it&mdash;for
the house of death itself was subdivided by a
harîm screen. Here, in a gloom made spectral by
the hanging lamps, women of repute for sanctity,
hired mourners, were reciting the Corân, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a>[Pg 190]</span>
through the screen some male professors could be
heard performing the same office in strong nasal
tones. The visitors bestowed their flowers and
bits of palm among the graves, and, having said
some prayers, returned to the apartment, where
preparations for a feast were being made.</p>

<p>Already the muezzin’s chant announced the
dawn. Murjânah Khânum was at her devotions
on a corner of the dais. The other ladies, who
deemed prayer the man’s affair, helped in the work
of setting out the breakfast. While this was going
on, a woman and three children rushed in from the
twilight court, and with loud blessings began kissing
hands.</p>

<p>“It is the wife and children of the guardian of
this place, who makes the graves,” Na’imah, her
nearest neighbour, informed Barakah. “They come
for their accustomed gifts of food and raiment.
See, Fitnah Khânum is just going to bestow them
in the name of all of us.”</p>

<p>A minute later the grave-digger’s wife and children
were at Barakah, kissing her hand repeatedly
and crying, “May it be many a year ere we receive
thee here, O queen of charms.”</p>

<p>The Englishwoman shivered at this form of
compliment; and then a strange old woman, who
had been observing her, sidled across the room and
squatted at her feet.</p>

<p>“O Umm ed-Dahak, welcome!” exclaimed
Na’imah. “Where hast thou been this long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a>[Pg 191]</span>
while, that we have not seen thee? There has
been no fun at all in life without thee. How is thy
health? What new jests dost thou bring us?”</p>

<p>But the old woman had not come, it seemed, to
talk to Na’imah; for, replying to these questions
in the briefest manner possible, she addressed herself
to Barakah in coaxing whispers.</p>

<p>“Art thou not happy, O my pearl? I could see
from over there that something ailed thee. Is it
the thought of death, the air of tombs? The
spectacle of graves should rather cheer the living.
Give praise to God that thou art still alive; enjoy
existence! Allah is merciful! It is certain that
He has made provision for our sex hereafter&mdash;a
finer paradise than that of men, in sh´Allah!
Ha, ha! What faces, thinkest thou, the men
would wear if they knew that we had heavenly
youths for our enjoyment, in our place apart?
By Allah, it would spoil their pleasure in the
black-eyed maids! I see them sulking even in the
home of bliss.... The air is chill thus early; the
end of night is always a sad hour. A delicate soft
flower like thee is dashed by it. Come, let me
talk to warm thee. I am called the Mother of
Laughter, thou hast heard!...</p>

<p>“Knowest thou what my daughter said in her
soul when first her spouse unveiled her? She said
(and be the saying far from thee), the while she
stood with eyes downcast and bosom rising, falling,
‘May Allah strike me blind this minute if I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a>[Pg 192]</span>
half so innocent as thou art, O my knowing lord!’
And she managed him, I can assure thee. Ah, she
fooled him perfectly&mdash;exclaiming ever at his wisdom,
bowing to his lightest word. It is thus we subtle
ones beguile the world&mdash;the great strong simpleton!&mdash;never
opposing, lest he knock us down. By
Allah, I must ask thy pardon for thus prattling;
but ladies condescend to find my talk amusing.
I can recount the origin of all that is, being most
learned in religious matters. If I chose, I could be
howling with those cats in there,”&mdash;she nodded
towards the hired performers in the tomb,&mdash;“but
they are hypocrites and gloomy. I love merriment.
It has long been my desire to meet a foreign lady,
to whom I might impart my knowledge of this land.
The Franks have great intelligence, and would
admire my lore. All the stories of the harîm I can
teach thee....</p>

<p>“Thou knowest the three wives of Ali Bey El
Halebi. The red-haired one&mdash;the former slave&mdash;was
killed last night. I had it but an hour ago
from a sure source. Her sin, though great, was
pardonable, Allah knows. Her husband had
neglected her disgracefully: the fact is known.
She turned for comfort to a street musician. She
lost her wit, it seems, and made confession. I
could have saved her, with the help of Allah, had
she come to me. The eunuchs held her so&mdash;and,
click! her neck was severed. Her corpse is
floating down the Nile, dismembered, or buried in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a>[Pg 193]</span>
the garden&mdash;Allah knows! Ah! I could keep thee
interested for a year together.”</p>

<p>The old creature’s flattery, more subtle in the
tone and manner than the words convey, was
irresistible; her twinkling eyes and ever-shifting
wrinkles aroused the Englishwoman’s sense of
humour, which had long been dormant.</p>

<p>“Praise be to Allah, thou art better!” smiled
the crone.</p>

<p>The sun had risen now; the lamps were useless;
the city of the dead was blushing like the rose;
the chanting of the readers in the tomb had lost
its sadness. Barakah was staring at the strange
old woman’s face, now plainly visible. Where had
she known it? Feature for feature, it resembled
one which had been long imprinted in her memory.
Umm ed-Dahak grinned when she became aware
of this perplexity. With a very roguish look
for one so old, she laid her cheek upon her open
palm and whispered, “Yûsuf! Come!” It was the
same old creature who, luring the future bride of
Yûsuf from her chamber in Muhammad Pasha’s
house, had been seized and beaten by the
eunuchs in the hall, and never seen again until
this day.</p>

<p>“Rememberest thou?” she slyly asked.
“Allah witness, I was tempted with a bribe.
Young men are devils! Never ask me to explain.
I cannot bear to be reminded of it, may Our
Lord forgive me! We are all weak creatures and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a>[Pg 194]</span>
succumb occasionally; but Fitnah Khânum will
assure thee I am to be trusted.”</p>

<p>With that and a most friendly smile, she edged
away, repairing straight to Fitnah Khânum, with
whom she held some animated conversation in low
tones. The lady, at her instance, shortly came
across to Barakah and whispered:</p>

<p>“That old woman seeks thy patronage. I
myself have found her useful and obliging. To
thee, a foreigner, she could afford much help.
Thou needest some one. Umm ed-Dahak is the best
I know.”</p>

<p>“Umm ed-Dahak!” cried out Na’imah. “Why,
there is no creature in the world to match her for
facetiousness. She was the rapture of our life
as children. Nobody could be dull or sad with
Umm ed-Dahak. She is like a monkey and a
clever servant and a mother all in one!”</p>

<p>This joyful cry was overheard by Leylah Khânum,
who frowned upon her daughter and rebuked her
sharply. In that place conversation must be held
in whispers and only ritual words pronounced
aloud. The party breakfasted in solemn silence,
to the sound of chanting from the tomb. But the
aged Mother of Laughter smiled and nodded&mdash;even
winked&mdash;at Barakah whenever their eyes met,
which was not seldom; and the Englishwoman
had a new sensation of relief and sympathy. At
last she had found somebody who understood her.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<!--chap--></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a>[Pg 195]</span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>


<p>Upon the morrow Barakah had quite forgotten the
old woman; she was lounging on a sofa, smoking
after breakfast, watching the slave-girls dress
Muhammad, when Umm ed-Dahak stole in barefoot,
making reverence. The crone sank down
before her as of right, and kissing her feet, asked
how she did and praised her loveliness. Then,
looking at the infant, she exclaimed in natural
tones, “Ma sh´Allah! May Our Lord preserve
him in all times and places!” and straightway
began making baby noises.</p>

<p>Barakah thought the moment opportune for getting
at the secret of that incident which teased her
memory. But Umm ed-Dahak, though she answered
volubly, made no disclosure. Indeed, as Barakah
soon learnt, that seeming reckless chatterer was in
the habit of imparting only what she chose to tell.</p>

<p>It was manifest that half her compliments were
insincere, nor did she take the slightest trouble
to disguise the fact; but in the intervals of
soporific fiction and pure blandishment she spoke
of things worth knowing in a tone of frank goodwill.
She knew the why and how of every custom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a>[Pg 196]</span>
the stories giving rise to every proverb, and was
so acute a judge of human character that her
gossip had the flavour of an intellectual game.
Her wiles, it seemed, were worn to show her
cleverness, or cynically, to travesty arts which
flourish in this transitory world.</p>

<p>She became a member of the household, but
with privileges. Barakah was the sultan, she the
grand vizier, it was agreed. No monarch ever had
a more delightful minister. She made the slave-girls
more attentive to their mistress, whose
comfort she increased in a variety of ways. She
knew where to lay her hands upon the leading
story-tellers and musicians, and was herself the
most accomplished female mountebank at that
time living. She soon learnt every mood of her
protectress, and its antidote. The latest scandal
dwelt at her tongue’s tip.</p>

<p>The whole harîm knew Umm ed-Dahak as a
joker. Slaves from outside were always coining
pretexts to enter the apartment, just to look at
her; and the more frivolous among the ladies
came to hear her stories.</p>

<p>“I am for them a comical performance, not
a child of Adam,” she told Barakah. “How
different from thy kindness, O my sovereign lady!
Thy gracious condescension feeds and clothes me.”</p>

<p>Therewith she kissed the hand of Barakah, who
was affected. By such small means did she confirm
her sway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a>[Pg 197]</span></p>

<p>Her intelligence, her laughing view of life, were
stimulating, and prevented Barakah from brooding
upon hopeless problems.</p>

<p>Without attempting to fatigue her mind in vain
attempts to grasp the universe&mdash;as Europeans do,
inviting pessimism&mdash;this old woman took her
portion as it came, with relish and a very searching
scrutiny. She likened herself sometimes to a
fisher of the Nile, who all his life frequents one
reach alone. He knows the currents and the mud-banks,
marks the winds, and, without preoccupation
with the river’s source or outlet, is cunning in
the art of bringing fish to land. The soul of her
philosophy was non-resistance; her morality held
all means lawful to escape oppression.</p>

<p>“God is gracious and all-knowing,” she would
shrug. “He gives to all His creatures, great and
small, the wherewithal to move in their appointed
element&mdash;to birds wings, fins to fishes, guile to
women.”</p>

<p>In her time, she admitted, many sins had soiled
her hands; shameful employments had defiled her
countenance. They would be pardoned, being
but a means to live. She held, against the world’s
opinion, that Allah is indulgent to the faults of
women and even has a secret fondness for them.
Yet, with her guile, she had an admiration for pure
virtue, a teardrop for true love, wherever found.
And with all her common sense and her acuteness
she was superstitious. As the fisher of the Nile,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a>[Pg 198]</span>
her chosen image, wears an amulet and names the
name of power before he casts his net, so Umm
ed-Dahak armed herself against malignant influences.
Her belief in witchcraft, philtres, and
all kinds of charms was quite beyond the reach of
argument.</p>

<p>The old woman never asked for any wages. She
took what food she wanted, helped herself to
cigarettes, and called for a narghileh when the
fancy seized her. By the Pasha’s order, in accordance
with a pious custom observed at that time in
good Muslim houses, eatables, such as meat and
milk and vegetables which might go bad, were not
kept overnight, the remainder of each day’s provision
being given in the evening to the poor
dependants. Of this dole Umm ed-Dahak claimed
her share. If she required a garment or a gift of
money, she did not beg for it, but told some
tortuous and lengthy story which ended in a present
as snakes end in tails. When Barakah saw through
the artifice, she was in no way disconcerted. She
merely smiled and praised her quick intelligence.</p>

<p>“Her need is real, for she is poor,” said Fitnah
Khânum, when Barakah remarked on the old
woman’s foibles. “But she loves subtlety far
more than comfort, and would refuse high monthly
wages, to obtain a lesser sum by stealth and
coaxing, as occasion offered. She has had much
money given to her, to my knowledge; but it is as
dust to her. She is like the clever fellow in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a>[Pg 199]</span>
story, who, having earned much money by his
ingenuity, scrambled it among the crowd; and in
the end, when it was finished, sighed, ‘O Allah,
would that I had all the gold on earth to go on
flinging it and see men fight like dogs for its possession!’”</p>

<p>Fitnah, though she scolded the old woman, had
a liking for her company and waggish talk. And
Umm ed-Dahak, being very diplomatic, paid her
court. Indeed, she flattered all the ladies of the
house with the assurance that she wished to be
the spokesman of their will with Barakah, and
went to them for orders every day.</p>

<p>The only person whom she feared was Yûsuf
Bey, though she had known him from a child.
At the first hint of his approach she fled the house.
In vain did Barakah assure her he had no objection
to her presence&mdash;nay, had said more than once that
he would like to see her. The old creature smiled
and wriggled, “May our Lord preserve him!”
but fled no less. It all came of her desire for
surreptitiousness. She would not have felt well
in a harîm of which the lord approved of her.</p>

<p>Contentment grew in Barakah from day to day,
and as the months wore on she lost the wish to go
abroad. The young Muhammad could now run
about, although he sometimes tumbled and set up
a howl. He had been taught to testify to his
religion in a piping voice and screamed at visitors,
“There is no God but God. Muhammad is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a>[Pg 200]</span>
apostle of God”; for which they blessed him.
He had also learned to curse the infidels ferociously.
A turbulent and wilful child, his mother and old
Umm ed-Dahak thought him perfect. They never
tired of watching him torment the slave-girls.
“Ma sh´Allah!” the Mother of Laughter would
croak rapturously. “A blusterer, by the Most
High! A boy with all the signs of manhood on
him! In sh´Allah, he will live to bully grown-up
men!”</p>

<p>Occasionally Barakah paid visits as in duty
bound; but she much preferred to stay indoors,
to smoke and dream and talk with Umm ed-Dahak.
Her husband, by his father’s influence, obtained a
post of some importance, necessitating their removal
shortly to a proper house, with a selamlik of
its own where he could see his courtiers. Barakah
looked forward to the change with high indifference,
though Umm ed-Dahak strove to waken her
enthusiasm, crying:</p>

<p>“Thou wilt now have eunuchs and a carriage of
thy very own. In sh´Allah, Yûsuf Bey will go on
rising till thy pomp excels the dignity of mighty
queens.”</p>

<p>Her life could hardly be more easy, she considered;
she was quite content. The Pasha’s
ladies would be grieved to lose her, and she would
feel quite lost apart from them. She thought they
all respected and admired her.</p>

<p>It was therefore a great shock to her when one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a>[Pg 201]</span>
afternoon Murjânah Khânum sent for her and read
her a kind lecture on her way of life.</p>

<p>“My pearl,” she said, “I am the head of this
harîm and in some sort responsible for all its
members. I do not see a slave degenerating without
endeavouring to stop the process by a word
of warning. How much greater is my duty towards
a near relation! My flower, thou art an Englishwoman
and we Turks of Europe and of Asia
welcomed thee to El Islâm as our own sister. We
looked to thee for force of character, for the light
of education, for refinement. What has happened,
on the contrary? Thou shunnest us for boon
companions, persons of the country, who, however
estimable, are inferior. Amînah Khânum yesterday
complained that thou art growing a fellâhah
both in speech and conduct. I do not hold with
her, I only tell thee what she said&mdash;a thing I cannot
bear to hear of my dear daughter. My child,
I speak in tenderness. Give thought to higher
things&mdash;our holy Faith, the dignity of life&mdash;and
spend not all thy time in mere frivolity. Keep
that old woman in her place; I say not shun
her, since she is amusing. Frequent good houses,
study holy books. To spend one’s whole life in
the hot room of the bath is not existence.”</p>

<p>Barakah was deeply hurt. To have her harmless
pleasures so severely criticized was as cruel as
to see a flower destroyed by hail. She could not
take the lofty standpoint of the Turkish lady.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a>[Pg 202]</span>
Had she done so, viewing life in all its horror, she
would have gone mad. How could she bear to
look upon herself, the renegade? She was now
glad that she was soon to leave that hateful house.</p>

<p>When she told Umm ed-Dahak of her grief,
expecting sympathy, the latter smiled and said:</p>

<p>“The right is with her. We must not neglect
the things divine. I will myself instruct thee in
them, having some small learning. In sh´Allah, I
will teach thee to endure those thoughts which
now appal thee.”</p>

<p>Instruction of that kind was needed two days
later, when Barakah was driven to her new abode.
As she alighted from her carriage at the door,
some men in waiting cut the throat of a live
buffalo by way of compliment. Blood spurted in
her path across the threshold.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>


<p>“Blood,” explained Umm ed-Dahak, “is but
the juice of living creatures. Had they crushed
a fruit before thee, would thy Grace have shrunk
or fainted? Those servants sacrificed a thing
of value in thy name and scattered blood upon
the threshold to bring thee good luck. The
flesh of the victim was distributed among the
needy, as an almsdeed to the credit of the house
of Yûsuf Bey. There are those among the learned
who declare such practices to be against religion.
Allah knows! Blood is the life of creatures,
and a precious offering; and our traditions say
that it is wise to shed it upon great occasions.
Do but apply thy mind, and thou shalt learn
to view such sacrifices with a sort of pleasure.
It is true, by Allah! There is a thrill peculiar
to the sight of blood.”</p>

<p>To this and many kindred exhortations Barakah
replied with shudders. She was downright ill.
At last, perceiving her repugnance to be quite
invincible, the old woman resigned that branch
of her instruction to the Most High, and once
more proffered only what she knew would please<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a>[Pg 204]</span>
her. Observing, also, her disgust at the sight
of blind, diseased, or crippled persons, numbers
of whom frequented the harîm in quest of alms,
she prevented such from entering her presence.</p>

<p>To gain some credit with Murjânah Khânum,
Umm ed-Dahak went and told her, “My sweet
lady is too frail. The weakness of the infidels
still clings to her. She cannot put her trust in
God as we do, but is harassed by the thought
of pain and illness. I have tried in vain to win
her to a better mind.”</p>

<p>“Leave that to Allah!” was the saint’s reply.
“All that I ask of her is to frequent her equals,
and not seclude herself in low frivolity.”</p>

<p>“To hear is to obey,” bowed Umm ed-Dahak.</p>

<p>She forthwith set to work to school her mistress
in all the courtesies expected of a noble lady. She
coached her for her visits, teaching her the names
of all the male relations, after whom it was the
custom to inquire although she could not know
them, together with the private history of each
lady of the house.</p>

<p>With such a commentator at her elbow, Barakah
found amusement in her social duties. Amînah
Khânum was as kind to her as ever, but made no
secret of her disapproval of the life she led.</p>

<p>“I know,” she said, “that thou must feel
bewildered sometimes. Our life here is so different
from that of Europe. It is natural for one
who has left much behind to seek forgetfulness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a>[Pg 205]</span>
in little pleasures. But why with vulgar natives of
the country? Why not with us, who are more
civilized and have a nobler view of El Islâm?
Thou art not the only European to be found
among us. I have asked some others here to
meet thee, and rid thee of the sense of loneliness,
which must be dreadful.”</p>

<p>She had in truth collected half a dozen other
European women who had married Muslims and
assumed the veil. But Barakah, instead of being
pleased to meet them, seemed annoyed. They
came from Italy and Southern Austria. To be
ranked with them aroused her English pride.
When Amînah Khânum asked why she disdained
them, she replied that they were women of the
lowest class and doubtful character.</p>

<p>“It is unlawful to say that,” the princess
scolded. “Such scorn is not permitted here
among us. A woman is invested with her husband’s
honour. It is a sin to cast up what she did before
her marriage. Thy boast is simply thou wast
better guarded. Praise God for that, but do not
scorn those others!”</p>

<p>Barakah loved them none the more for this
rebuke.</p>

<p>In her new dwelling she had three reception-rooms.
The gilt salon was kept for very ceremonious
visitors. Her intimates were welcomed
in a large apartment with cushioned dais and
divans round the wall, where she herself was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a>[Pg 206]</span>
wont to sit with Umm ed-Dahak, though sometimes
they would camp upon the housetop under
sunshades.</p>

<p>All kinds of suitors came to the selamlik to
see Yûsuf; and most of these brought presents,
some of which were left at the haramlik entrance
to bespeak the intercession of the lady. Ghandûr
was made the steward of the house; he and his
wife, who still attended on Muhammad, inhabiting
a room close by. Barakah was glad to hear his
voice again. As a relative by milk, he was allowed
sometimes to kiss her hand and raise his chant
of honour in her presence.</p>

<p>The winter following her change of residence
Barakah was once more brought to bed. The
whole household had been praying for another
boy; Muhammad had been taught to lisp, “A
boy, in sh´Allah!” every time he saw his mother.
Umm ed-Dahak had desired her mistress might
produce boys only, because, she said, some of
the brood were sure to die, and were all boys
there was less likelihood of being left with girls
alone, like Leylah Khânum. But a girl it proved
to be. Muhammad shook his little fist at the
intruder, shouting, “Daughter of a dog, who
bade thee enter?” There was little joy at her
reception in the world, and that little raised to
cheer the mother’s spirits.</p>

<p>“It is no matter,” chuckled Umm ed-Dahak,
whose optimism triumphed over every obstacle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a>[Pg 207]</span></p>

<p>“A girl comes not amiss; she has her uses. Since
some are bound to die in early childhood, it is as
well in every family to have a few who can be
spared. And Yûsuf Bey will thank thee for this
gift. The fathers always like to have a girl or two.”</p>

<p>“Why should some die? In sh´Allah, both of
mine will be preserved!” wailed Barakah.</p>

<p>“In sh´Allah! Yet if all the children born were
to survive, there soon would not be room to move in
our great houses. For example, take the palace
of our lord the Pasha, thy good father. Let me
see!” She sat in thought and counted on her
fingers: “Murjânah Khânum bore him twenty at
the least&mdash;all dead; Fitnah Khânum more than
that&mdash;say thirty&mdash;of whom six alive. The mother
of Ali&mdash;she that was a slave&mdash;ten at the least, three
living. Then there was another concubine ...”</p>

<p>“Stop, stop! It is not true! It cannot be,”
cried Barakah, with a hysteric laugh.</p>

<p>But Umm ed-Dahak answered, “True, wallahi.
What dismays thee? A woman’s task is to produce.
We leave the rest to Allah.”</p>

<p>And to console her hearer she went on to tell
of broods of thirty, even forty, reared successfully;
when Barakah’s dismay was turned to laughter.</p>

<p>In her moments of depression she was haunted
by two terrors on her son’s account. One was
ophthalmia, a disease so prevalent in Egypt that
half the population was composed of blind and
one-eyed persons. The other was the plague, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a>[Pg 208]</span>
which the women told grim stories with a strange
complacency. Many of her friends had been
through epidemics of the pestilence and, by their
own report, had known no panic. It was a swift
and cruel illness, by which they had lost dear ones
in despite of careful nursing; it was from Allah;
no one’s thinking could avert or cure it. The
horror the mere thought of it inspired in Barakah,
her futile worry, filled them with a placid wonder.</p>

<p>She had made up her mind that, if the plague
drew near, she would carry off her boy to Europe,
having no doubt but she could win consent from
Yûsuf. But she said nothing of this resolution
to the women, knowing they would deem it
godless. As a preventive against ophthalmia,
she bathed her son’s eyes with cold water twice
a day, and gave orders for the flies that settled
on them to be brushed away&mdash;a thing the slaves
would not have thought of doing on their own
initiative.</p>

<p>The plague did not come near her; and Muhammad’s
eyes continued bright and liquid under
long black lashes. An enemy, unfeared as unexpected,
struck her joy.</p>

<p>About the period when he was being weaned,
Muhammad had a serious illness. An Armenian
doctor was called in, who said, “It is the fever.”
At that the women wailed and prayed to Allah.
The foe was too well known, the scourge of children.
There was no need to tell them what to do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a>[Pg 209]</span></p>

<p>“It carries off a host of infants every year,”
said Umm ed-Dahak. “But be not downcast,
O beloved. God is great! Many survive, and
those who do recover are free from its malignancy
for evermore.”</p>

<p>The malady was typhoid fever, or so like it that
Barakah could not detect the slightest difference.
She had been often told that it did not attack the
natives of the land, but only Europeans, who were
thought more delicate. Here, then, was the reason.
The natives who grew up were all inoculated, having
been through the disease in infancy.</p>

<p>Muhammad lived, for which his mother gave
wild thanks to Allah, and performed a hundred
alms-deeds she had vowed in her suspense. But a
year later her small daughter died of the same
scourge, and in the after years she lost five children
by it.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV"></a>CHAPTER XXV</h2>


<p>Her boy was her delight in life. No other woman
was allowed to scold him. When Yûsuf slapped
him in the cause of order, which happened often,
for the child was naughty, she made it up to him
with sugar-plums and fond caresses. In his
father’s absence Muhammad was the lord of the
harîm; all vied to please him. His foster-mother
and the servants told him fairy stories in which
good children killed all kinds of monsters. One,
which he never tired of hearing, ended thus:</p>

<p>“Then little Hâfiz took a sword and reaped the
head of the atrocious ghoul; and beat to death the
hag who had ill-used him, and with the help of all
the neighbours, who acclaimed his goodness, burnt
all his wicked little cousins in a cheerful fire.”</p>

<p>He knew that tale by heart and went about
repeating it. He had a lot of toys, but none which
gave him so much pleasure as a little cane. With
this he beat the slave-girls, uttering terrific curses.
The victims, for his satisfaction, made believe
to cry, and assured him they were seriously
injured. His mother and old Umm ed-Dahak
praised his manly spirit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a>[Pg 211]</span></p>

<p>Fitnah Khânum sometimes shook her head
and spoke of necessary discipline. Barakah only
smiled; as she did also, when young Na’imah,
puffed up with pride of her new motherhood,
exclaimed: “By Allah, I will bring up my son
otherwise.” But when the prim and dainty
Turkish ladies looked fastidious, glancing around
her room where toys lay scattered, she felt angry.
The salons of those ladies were maintained in
spotless cleanliness; their children, though untidy
to avert ill-fortune, were as courtly as small
chamberlains towards their elders.</p>

<p>“It is strange! Thou art an Englishwoman,
yet thou likest these things!” Amînah Khânum
exclaimed once, remarking her affection for a
certain sweetstuff, common in the markets but unknown
in decent houses&mdash;a taste she had acquired
through Umm ed-Dahak. “Thou art too much
with the women of the country. Be more discerning
in the choice of friends.”</p>

<p>But Barakah was happy as she was; or, if not
altogether happy, chose to seem so from a blend of
pride and indolence. Against the condescension
of the Turkish ladies she armed her dignity with
the reflection that she was born above all Eastern
women. Yet she dared not let remembrance dwell
on England for fear of terrible misgivings she had
sworn to banish. Her boy, she thought, should
be her vindication. He was visibly superior to
other children of the land.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a>[Pg 212]</span></p>

<p>To him, clasped tightly to her breast, she poured
out all her secret and tormenting thoughts.</p>

<p>The English had ill-treated her most shamefully.
Her son must hate the English for her sake.
And yet he must remember he was half an Englishman,
a being of a different order from the children
round him. And when he prayed he must ask
Allah to increase his strength and wisdom, so that
he might prove a match for any Englishman he
might encounter in the course of life. The child,
with bright eyes, drank in all she said, but God
alone knew what his mind could make of it; for
Barakah’s opinions were a tangle as of angry
serpents, their utterance as incoherent as the
cries of battle. She heard him once hurl “Englishwoman!”
at a slave who had enraged him. The
girl laughed back: “Thy mother is an Englishwoman,”
when he replied: “A noble race and
warlike&mdash;the Muslimîn among them, like my
mother. But thou art a low Christian of that race,
a filthy harlot!”</p>

<p>Outside her own house and her husband’s family
Barakah’s chief friends were Gulbeyzah and
Bedr-ul-Budûr. With them she laid aside the
pride which had become her usual armour in
society. Yet Gulbeyzah said one day when
Barakah was calling on her: “How thou art
changed! Rememberest thou the days when we
talked French together? Then thou wast as
timid and demure as mice are; and so good and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a>[Pg 213]</span>
wise! Now thou art a high and mighty Arab
lady. I am half afraid!”</p>

<p>“Thou too art greatly changed, O wicked joker!”
cried Barakah, impounding the Circassian’s hand.
“Rememberest thou the little window in the
passage?”</p>

<p>“Hush!” said Gulbeyzah, with uplifted finger.
“By Allah, thou art owner of a shameless memory.
But come with me!”</p>

<p>She led her friend away from the reception-room,
upstairs, and showed her such another little
window as that they both remembered, looking
out on distant roofs. “I come and dream here
sometimes as of old&mdash;I, the mother of two
children!” sighed Gulbeyzah. “There is a roof
well fitted for a hopeless lover, but no one ever
comes. Now thou knowest that I have not
changed my foolish nature, although in motherhood
I have acquired a soul.”</p>

<p>That the Turkish ladies rather wondered at her
preference for Gulbeyzah and Bedr-ul-Budûr, two
former slaves, made Barakah the more enamoured
of their friendship. Muhammad was allowed to
visit them, and play games with their children, a
transcendent favour; and it was with a horror as
of treason and of base ingratitude that she heard
them, too, declare that he was sadly spoilt.</p>

<p>It was at the wedding-feast which Tâhir, the
great singer, gave his daughter. The ladies of the
grand harîms flocked thither eagerly, for it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a>[Pg 214]</span>
known that Tâhir would perform. The two
Circassians found out Barakah amid the throng,
and went and sat with her in a deserted corner.
Muhammad had that day been playing with the
children of Gulbeyzah’s house.</p>

<p>“He is a little tyrant!” said his hostess, laughing.
“A young savage. He attacked my little
girl as if to kill her, because she tried to get back
her own doll. I had to shake him. I told him
that his mother would be very angry at his conduct.
He cursed my religion and then spat at me. By
our lady Zeynab, thou shouldst beat him sometimes,
O my soul!”</p>

<p>“His spirit is too high and needs restraining.
Every one says so,” said Bedr-ul-Budûr.</p>

<p>“You must have thwarted him. He is not used
to it. He has the noblest, the most generous
nature,” answered Barakah.</p>

<p>“By Allah, it is difficult not to thwart a boy
who claims the eyes from out one’s face as his to
play with! He must be denied, and when denied
he grows infuriated,” said Gulbeyzah mildly.</p>

<p>Barakah was on the point of making a fierce
answer, when the glorious voice of Tâhir rose,
compelling silence. She had heard a hundred
singers, male and female, since she came to Cairo;
but Tâhir’s voice alone had power to move her.
The others mouthed and shrieked to individual
passions; but Tâhir took the soul and soared with
it, producing exaltation and a sense of peace. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a>[Pg 215]</span>
sang from the pure heart of El Islâm, and shed its
fervent calm on all who heard him. When the
song died she had forgotten anger.</p>

<p>That wedding-feast became for ever memorable
by reason of a shocking tragedy at its conclusion.
Barakah and her friends were led by Umm ed-Dahak,
who was a relative of Tâhir’s wife, to view
the nuptial chamber. It was full of flowering
plants; the bed, with silken coverings, was quite
embowered. In addition to the odour of so many
blossoms the air was thick with perfumes burnt
and sprinkled. The room, they were informed,
had been arranged, the flowers provided, by rich
admirers of the singer’s talent.</p>

<p>“By Allah, pretty! But I should not like to
sleep there!” had been Gulbeyzah’s comment, little
guessing what would happen. For next morning
it was known to high and low, through all the city,
that the bridegroom and the bride had died of
suffocation. When people went to rouse them in
the morning they found corpses. The news was
brought to Barakah by Umm ed-Dahak, who had
herself been present at the sad discovery. She
told the story with an artist’s relish.</p>

<p>“What did Tâhir do? The poor demented
father? What did he? He took his lute and
struck the chords and sang a song more mournful
than was ever heard on earth till now. Many
present had to leave the room in grievous pains.
And then, with the last note&mdash;C-r-r-a-c-k!&mdash;he broke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a>[Pg 216]</span>
the lute, and swore the binding oath that he would
never sing again. In sh´Allah he will change his
mind,” said Umm ed-Dahak, in her ordinary tone.
“The world would lack a soul without his singing.
His oath has spread despair through all the town.”</p>

<p>For months the news of Tâhir was demanded
eagerly. After his daughter’s death he went to
Tantah for a while. Returning to the capital,
prepared to keep his vow, he took a shop and
furnished it with goods, intending to become
a merchant. He thought to work out bargains
over cups of coffee, by way of pastime only, for
he was a wealthy man. But the people, his
admirers, would not have it. They thronged his
shop directly it was opened, and bought up all
his goods in a few hours, paying the price first
asked without a protest. He stocked his shop
again; the same thing happened, till, finding
himself debarred from occupation, he cursed the
day when he was born; and in the end repaired
to the Grand Câdi, and asked for liberation from
his vow. The reverend judge released him with
a grin and “Praise to Allah!” It was what his
Honour and the whole of Egypt had been wanting.
Enormous crowds assembled to hear Tâhir call
to noonday prayer at the great mosque El Azhar&mdash;the
first occasion of his singing since his daughter’s
death.</p>

<p>“The praise to Allah, we possess him once
again,” said Umm ed-Dahak, when reporting his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a>[Pg 217]</span>
defeat. “It has cost us trouble to regain him,
Allah knows. He did wrong to swear that oath;
which was as impious as swearing to cut off his
hand or foot, the work of God; and so the Câdi
told him in his judgment yesterday. He brought
the grief upon himself by doting on the girl above
her merits, calling her his soul of music, neglecting
the son who is still with him&mdash;a fine lad. By
the Prophet, it was courting sorrow to make all
that fuss about a daughter. Now had it been
his son, his source of honour&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Barakah interrupted with a prayer to Allah
to avert the omen of her stabbing fear. She
clutched Muhammad to her bosom; but he,
intent on playthings, kicked and struggled, even
swore at her. And at that moment Fitnah
Khânum was announced.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<!--chap--></div>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>


<p>When Fitnah Khânum entered, the small boy
was stamping about on the dais, hurling frightful
imprecations at his mother, who was on her
knees endeavouring to soothe him. His fez was
off, and he had trampled on it in his rage; he
tore his clothing. Umm ed-Dahak, crouching
by the wall with her narghileh, made clucking
noises to attract the child; while the wife of
Ghandûr, standing, smiled upon the scene, awaiting
the command to bear him off. The floor was littered
with his broken playthings. The light that
filtered in through the rich lattice was blue with
all the dust that he had raised.</p>

<p>“Look, here comes thy grandmother, a great
lady. Hush, O Muhammad! Be a good boy.
I will give thee such nice sweeties.”</p>

<p>“Mayest thou be ravished and then cut in
pieces!” shrieked Muhammad, knuckling both
his eyes. Therewith he spurned his mother with
his foot.</p>

<p>The visitor remained a moment petrified. It
was the first time she had seen her grandson
at his worst. Then, boxing both ears of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a>[Pg 219]</span>
wife of Ghandûr, who stood grinning near her,
she rushed upon the wicked boy, and slapped him
hard, regardless of his kicks and blows, his horrid
language.</p>

<p>“Learn to respect thy mother, little malefactor,”
she admonished him, enforcing every
word with punishment. “Thou art no better
than a heathen, than a wild beast. Thou wilt
merit fire hereafter!”</p>

<p>But Barakah sprang on her like a tigress. “He
is my child! Let him alone!” she panted.</p>

<p>“He is thy child, truly, but a Muslim first.
To curse and kick his mother is a dreadful crime.”</p>

<p>“Let him alone, I say! By Allah, no one shall
chastise my son but me, his mother!”</p>

<p>The ladies, both alike indignant, screamed
against each other; Umm ed-Dahak, ever ready
to applaud a truth, however adverse, begged
her mistress to hear wisdom from the mouth of
Fitnah Khânum; the wife of Ghandûr was in
tears, and all the slave-girls, assembling in the
hope to see a fight, shrieked prayers to Allah
and implored the ladies to be calm. Muhammad,
in disgust at being quite forgotten, set up a dismal
howl, which no one heeded.</p>

<p>At length, perceiving the futility of further argument,
the visitor retired, by no means vanquished.</p>

<p>“The child must be removed if thou wilt not
control him,” were her parting words, unheard of
any one amid the din.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a>[Pg 220]</span></p>

<p>In the greatest agitation and distress of mind,
Fitnah Khânum went back to her carriage and
was driven home. She sought immediate audience
of Murjânah Khânum. She had a warm affection
for the wife of Yûsuf, and something like a passion
for her little grandson. The need to take stern
measures with them filled her eyes with tears;
but her religion nerved her to perform a duty.
A scene like that she had just witnessed must
never be allowed to be repeated in a Muslim
house.</p>

<p>Murjânah’s look grew worried as she heard
the story.</p>

<p>“I have spoken to the dear one once, and fain
would never speak to her again in chiding tones,”
she murmured. “I pity her extremely, for she
is alone among us and, I think, afraid. Consider
what might have become of one of us if set down
all alone amid the life of Europe! But it devolves
on us to intervene since Yûsuf, as thou sayest,
will not act against her.”</p>

<p>As a result of Fitnah’s allegations, Murjânah
Khânum called a council of the matrons of the
family, including in the number her ex-slave,
Gulbeyzah, who, as Barakah’s best friend, might
plead her cause. But Gulbeyzah, when the case
was laid before her, shrugged and cried:</p>

<p>“By Allah, it is true, she will destroy the child!
How often have I tried to warn her! But she
is haughty in her weakness, and impatient of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"></a>[Pg 221]</span>
advice. She loves the fawning voice of her own
servants. She has greatly changed. Yûsuf Bey,
however, is for discipline. She has more than
once complained to me of his severity towards
the boy.”</p>

<p>“What good is that when she consoles Muhammad
afterwards, and talks about his cruel father?
I have heard her,” put in Na’imah, who was a
member of the conclave, though a child in years.
She spoke with great excitement. All the ladies
smiled. Murjânah Khânum touched her cheek
affectionately, and called her the most excellent
of little mothers. Murjânah added:</p>

<p>“The whole trouble, as I see it, is her want of
faith. She has lost the comfort of her own
religion, without acquiring ours in more than
name. Is such a woman, full of cowardice and
self-indulgence, fit to rear a Muslim? Unless
she change her whole behaviour, which appears
unlikely, for her strength is gone, will it be wise
to leave the child with her?”</p>

<p>“No!” came from all sides.</p>

<p>“Let his grandmother take charge of him,”
said Leylah Khânum.</p>

<p>“God forbid!” cried Fitnah, “lest his mother
hate me. Let him be given to the wisest, most
benign of women, to our dear Murjânah.”</p>

<p>This motion won applause from all the ladies
on the divan. They smiled to one another with
rouged lips and kohled eyes. The room was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a>[Pg 222]</span>
beautifully cool and sweet, the cigarettes were
of the best, the coffee excellent, and every one
enjoyed the sense of doing serious business.</p>

<p>Murjânah showed no fear of the responsibility.
Assured of Fitnah Khânum’s gracious help, she
said the task of civilizing the small boy would
not displease her; but first the menfolk had
to be consulted, and due warning must be given
to the luckless mother. The ladies Fitnah, Leylah,
and Murjânah were deputed to convey the verdict
of the council to the Pasha and to Yûsuf Bey,
who were invited to Murjânah’s rooms that
evening.</p>

<p>Yûsuf displayed some irritation when he heard
the charges.</p>

<p>“But my wife is a Frank!” he cried. “Allah
knows it is but natural her ways should be different
from ours.”</p>

<p>Murjânah took no notice of the interruption,
but proceeded to relate the scene described by
Fitnah. She mentioned also facts which he
could not gainsay, as that Muhammad never
kissed his father’s hand, that he sat down in
his father’s presence without asking leave, and
that he did not wait upon his parents as behoved
a child. Yûsuf was silenced, though he looked
annoyed. The Pasha wore his blandest diplomatic
visage.</p>

<p>“With thy permission, O my lord,” said the
great lady, “we have thought upon this matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a>[Pg 223]</span>
and discussed it fully. If it be allowed for us
to proffer a suggestion, it is that thou, who didst
endow the bride of Yûsuf and stand in some
sort for her people at the wedding, shouldst of
thy gracious favour go and reason with her.”</p>

<p>The Pasha, fingering his beads, observed that
God is merciful.</p>

<p>“Of thy kindness condescend to view the case,”
she urged. “The boy is brought up utterly
devoid of reverence. What is his fate when he
goes out to face the world&mdash;unmannerly, rebellious,
a mad dog, a savage, detestable alike to great
and small. Of what use will he be to El Islâm?
Oh, God forbid that he should grow like that&mdash;a
scourge to his two parents, and the scorn of
others. It is to save him and his mother from
the consequences of her folly that we beg thee
of thy mercy to remonstrate with her, and if she
will not hearken, to confide the education of
the child to us. The word is spoken. May our
Lord preserve thee ever!”</p>

<p>“May Allah help us all!” replied the Pasha
gently.</p>

<p>When he and Yûsuf had departed from the
ladies and were returning through dim corridors
to the selamlik, he inquired:</p>

<p>“What sayest thou?”</p>

<p>“They much exaggerate,” said Yûsuf warmly.
“I keep an eye upon the boy. In course of time
I shall correct his conduct.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a>[Pg 224]</span></p>

<p>“Do it now!”</p>

<p>“What meanest thou? Why dost thou smile,
my father?”</p>

<p>“I smile because I have observed that when
the women take that tone&mdash;‘of thy great kindness
deign to listen,’ and the rest, there is no safe
course for man but to obey. The boy is five
years old and it is time he learnt behaviour. It is
thy business, O my son; remonstrate with her.”</p>

<p>“Nay, for they charged thee with the office.”</p>

<p>“It is thine of right.”</p>

<p>“Very gladly I resign it to thee. Thy words
have more weight. And how can I turn round
upon her suddenly? She will think me mad.”</p>

<p>“By Allah, I implore thee to perform thy
duty.”</p>

<p>“By the Prophet, I beseech, adjure thee to
befriend me now, as thou hast done from childhood.
I will tell her to expect a visit from thee
in the morning.”</p>

<p>“Well, God is greatest!” The good Pasha
heaved a sigh, proclaiming his acceptance of the
part allotted.</p>

<p>Accordingly, next morning, arrayed in his
official black frock-coat and newest fez, he waited
upon Barakah, who received him with delight,
evidently unsuspecting the real purpose of his
visit. He thought that Yûsuf might at least
have warned her. However, with a shrug,
he opened business in his usual courtly and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a>[Pg 225]</span>
confiding manner, speaking in French, since
servants are born eavesdroppers.</p>

<p>“Madame my daughter,” he began, “from the
moment when you did my house the honour of
espousing my dear son, I have been your servant
and admirer; that is known. Yûsuf himself has
not more tender veneration for your many virtues
and accomplishments, so rare among us.” He
went on to recite the panegyric of her general
conduct as a wife and mother, paid tribute to her
beauty and her piety, and then said, “But
there is one small point on which I have to scold
you. In your great goodness, your untiring
kindness, you forget to claim the service due to
you. Your slaves, as I have heard, grow fat and
lazy, and though devoted to you&mdash;as what soul
would not be?&mdash;do not keep your house so
scrupulously clean and nicely ordered as the
dwelling-place of such a treasure ought to be. I
beg you to make hard your heart from time to
time, to think a little less for others and more
often for yourself. Even your own son should
be brought up to reverence you, as one to whom
he owes incalculable debts of gratitude. He
should kiss your hand whenever he approaches,
and bow and ask your blessing when he takes
his leave. It is our custom for small children
and, I think, a good one. How is the little one
this morning? Am I not to be allowed to see
him for one moment?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a>[Pg 226]</span></p>

<p>Barakah clapped her hands and, when a slave
appeared, gave order for Muhammad to be brought.
He came in presently, escorted by his foster-mother,
who stood and watched his progress to
the dais with loving smiles. He was in docile
mood, and Barakah detained him, giving the wife
of Ghandûr leave to go.</p>

<p>“What fault is there to find in his behaviour?”
she inquired in French, with arch defiance of the
Pasha.</p>

<p>“None in the world,” he made reply, with vast
politeness, “except that he has not kissed hands,
nor waited your permission to sit down with us.”</p>

<p>“Absurd!” laughed Barakah.</p>

<p>“Absurd, in verity, like many of our customs.
Only, my cherished daughter, he is one of us and
must observe them. If you refuse to teach him
the behaviour which we consider fitting for young
children, I announce with deep regret that we must
take him from you.”</p>

<p>Barakah gasped. She looked for signs of
jesting; but the Pasha’s visage, though urbane, was
serious.</p>

<p>“It has been told me,” he continued very
gravely, “that this boy, when angry, kicks and
curses his own mother. That is, for us others,
a most dreadful crime, apart from the regard in
which I hold you personally. My grandson must
not be brought up to shame our house; the
authority of the family must be exerted to avert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a>[Pg 227]</span>
dishonour. In fact, dear madame, if you will not
punish him, he must be given for a while to some one
who will do so.”</p>

<p>“But it is unheard of!” cried the mother
wildly. “How can you think of such abominable
cruelty? He is my child. My right to him
exists in nature.”</p>

<p>“And is inalienable,” said the Pasha, with a
splendid bow. “No one else can ever bear him,
but some one else will have to educate him, since
madame refuses.”</p>

<p>“I am an Englishwoman. I shall complain
to my Consul.”</p>

<p>“Believe me, dear madame, he will not listen.
Your son is a Turkish subject; we inhabit Egypt;
and in a case of this sort we allow no interference.
The English are a race distinguished for intelligence
and force of character; I beg you to display those
qualities on this occasion.”</p>

<p>He left her in hysterics, clinging fiercely to her
boy.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII"></a>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>


<p>No sooner was the Pasha gone than Umm ed-Dahak
crept back softly to her mistress and cooed of consolation
in her ear. Muhammad, who had started
howling out of sympathy, she told to go and play
with Ghandûr’s son.</p>

<p>“By Allah, it is all my fault, not thine,” she
whispered. “I ought to have foreseen this grief
and warned thee. Vex not thy soul at all! It is
no matter! Praise be to Allah, we can change our
policy. To-morrow thou wilt beat thy son a little,
and all the world will praise thy management.”</p>

<p>But the mother’s tears were flowing less from
sense of guilt than for the helplessness, the lack of
energy, which she discovered in herself at such a
crisis. The call to make an effort paralysed her;
she hung on Umm ed-Dahak like a frightened child,
agreeing with loud sobs to the old woman’s statement
that on the morrow they would make a new
beginning.</p>

<p>That afternoon the little boy had been invited
to Gulbeyzah’s house. His mother being too
unwell to bear him company, he started off on foot
in the custody of Ghandûr. Barakah adjured him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a>[Pg 229]</span>
to be very good and mind his manners, on which he
kissed her with a most angelic smile.</p>

<p>“See how obedient and how good he is!” she
wailed, her anguish breaking out afresh when he was
gone. “How can they say he is not well brought
up?”</p>

<p>“Without a doubt they have been misinformed,”
cooed Umm ed-Dahak. “They have mistaken
some exceptional disorder for his general conduct
Ma sh´Allah! With but a touch of discipline, a very
little teaching of good manners, thou wilt make him
glorious, a pattern to all other children of this age.”</p>

<p>But Muhammad, who had set forth as an angel,
returned a little devil, in a sullen rage. He would
not speak a word, refused all nourishment, and sat
aloof with frowning brows and gnashing teeth.
Ghandûr, who brought him home, had sent in word
that he had been a naughty boy and needed punishment.
So Ghandûr also was his mother’s enemy.</p>

<p>Muhammad struck at all the women who came
near him. He swore by the Most High to ravish
every one of them, to tear their eyes out and cut
off their hands and feet. The servants laughed at
his ferocious impotence, which made things worse.
When his mother came and knelt beside him, he at
first repelled her; but after half an hour’s incessant
coaxing she elicited his cause of grief.</p>

<p>He had been pretending in his play to kill
Gulbeyzah’s little girl&mdash;“not really hurting her,”
he blubbered, “though she shrieked like a dying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a>[Pg 230]</span>
fowl”&mdash;when all at once, without the slightest
provocation, a big boy assailed him, flung him down
and knelt upon him, pinning his two hands.
While he was in that position the ladies of the
harîm had come in and reviled him, praising his
cruel persecutor as a hero. They had then conveyed
him, kicking, to Ghandûr, who, like the
beast he was, believed their lies.</p>

<p>“It is no matter, O beloved! Dry thy
tears! Never&mdash;never shalt thou visit that unfriendly
house again,” his mother whispered.</p>

<p>Muhammad hiccuped on a sob, “Wallahi!”
and fell again to gnashing of his teeth and moaning.</p>

<p>“See!” murmured Umm ed-Dahak. “See his
dauntless spirit! By Allah, it is true, he must be
tamed a little.”</p>

<p>That night he cried himself to sleep, and in the
morning was snappish and morose, with furtive
eyes. About the fourth hour of the day his mother
missed him, and having sought through all the
house in vain, conceived grave fears. She sent a
eunuch to the Pasha’s palace, while Ghandûr cried
the tidings through the quarter. Distraught with
grief, she ran from room to room in the hottest
hours of the day, always expecting to find Muhammad
hiding somewhere. At last she sank down
on a couch, exhausted.</p>

<p>The third hour after noon, as she was lying thus,
Gulbeyzah and her durrahs were announced.
They entered with much tragic exclamation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a>[Pg 231]</span>
Then the truth was known. Muhammad had
repaired that morning to their house and joined the
children’s games, appearing friendly. But he was
only waiting for his chance of vengeance; for, luring
Gulbeyzah’s little girl apart, he stabbed her with
a dagger he had got&mdash;the Lord knew how!&mdash;and
cried to her big brother, “Thy account, O tyrant!”</p>

<p>His victim&mdash;praise to Allah&mdash;was not killed;
nor even, by His mercy, maimed for life; but the
ensuing uproar in the house may be imagined.
The murderous child had been imprisoned in a
room apart; the lord of the harîm, when summoned,
had sent at once for Yûsuf Bey, who was even now
examining the culprit. Directly the responsibility
had been lifted off them, they (the ladies) had flown
straight to Barakah to assure her of their unimpaired
affection. But&mdash;merciful Allah!&mdash;what was
the world coming to? They sought refuge in Allah
from such revengeful fury in so small a child.</p>

<p>“You must have used him very cruelly,” the
mother cried. “He is by nature the most generous
of children, not a criminal!”</p>

<p>At that, all four began to talk at once. Barakah
talked against them, and the slave-girls and
dependants, looking on, raised cries. The argument
was at its height when Yûsuf was announced.
The din ceased instantly. The four Circassians
raised their mouth-veils in alarm and slipped away;
the servants, silenced, went into another room.</p>

<p>Yûsuf entered, stern of countenance, dragging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a>[Pg 232]</span>
by the arm the peccant boy, whose mouth hung
open, while his eyes stared wildly, fixed in the
imbecility of abject fear.</p>

<p>Barakah fell down at her husband’s feet and
screamed for mercy. He was obdurate.</p>

<p>“Let be, O woman!” he commanded. “My
child, as trained by thee, is now a malefactor. He
robs and kills; he breaks the law of hospitality.
He stole a weapon from Ghandûr, his foster-father,
and with it stabbed a little girl, whose guest he
was. Henceforth I take him from thee, and give
him to my mothers to be educated. Seek not to
counteract their efforts, or by the Ca’abah I will
beat thee soundly as I now beat him.”</p>

<p>With that, he marched his son into an inner
room, whence presently there issued sounds of
blows and bitter wailing. Barakah ground her
face upon the floor and stopped her ears.</p>

<p>Muhammad, by his father’s orders, was shut off
from her that night; and the next morning, before
Yûsuf went to business, the Pasha’s harîm carriage
came to fetch the child. The eunuch brought a
letter from Murjânah Khânum, inviting Barakah
to come and give her counsel. But Barakah’s
sole answer was an angry cry.</p>

<p>For several days she would not budge from
her own rooms, refused to see the Pasha’s ladies
when they called, and persisted, notwithstanding
every argument, in posing as the victim of most
foul injustice. And Umm ed-Dahak coaxed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a>[Pg 233]</span>
soothed her all that while. At length, one day,
Murjânah Khânum entered, unannounced; and
Barakah, in act to rise and make indignant protest,
was silenced by the sight of her own child.</p>

<p>“Go, O Muhammad, do what I have told thee,”
said the old lady, with her hand on the boy’s
shoulder. Whereat Muhammad went up gravely
and bowed over his mother’s hand to kiss it, but
she caught him in her arms, preventing him. He
called out to Murjânah Khânum that it was not
fair, and struggled to get free. She put him down,
when he went on with his polite performance, kissed
her hand and pressed his forehead to it, inquired
after her health and asked her blessing; and then
in the most courtly Arabic asked what he had done
that one of his parents, who were dearer to him
than all living creatures, should punish him by
five days of avoidance.</p>

<p>“The harîm of my grandfather, Muhammad
Pasha Sâlih, depute me to request that thou wilt
honour us this day and every day with thy most
gracious presence, O my mother.”</p>

<p>Before the termination of this speech and
ceremony, Barakah was lying on her face in tears.
She had thought, through the long hours of deprivation,
that they were teaching her own child to
disregard, if not to hate her. The relief was great.
Murjânah sat beside her and caressed her, while
Muhammad, standing reverently, looked concerned.</p>

<p>They took her with them in the carriage to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234"></a>[Pg 234]</span>
Pasha’s house, where, instead of reprobation, she
met boundless sympathy. The ladies Fitnah and
Murjânah told her all that had been done for the
small boy, with evident anxiety for her approval.
Muhammad showed her all the harîm pets. He
bade a slave-girl bring his own white doves. She
brought three in her bosom. At his call, they flew
to him and settled on his head and shoulders.
There dwelt a parrot in the house of Na’imah, a
monkey in the house of Fitnah Khânum, which
she had to visit; as well as roving cats, and little
birds in cages, and several street-dogs who came
round for food. He also showed with pride his
plot of garden, consisting of a box of scented
herbs. And all the while that she was in the
house, he waited on her like a page, kissing her
hand whenever he could get a chance, and telling
her the joy he felt in seeing her. When, left
alone with him, she strove to whisper consolation,
he shook his head decidedly, and told her: “O
my mother, I have learnt to know that I was very
wicked. Thou wast ever much too gentle and too
kind with me. Allah knows how much I love thee&mdash;my
grandmothers have taught me that&mdash;but it
is well that I should be removed from thee a while
and brought to reverence. It is not right that one
so delicate as thou art should have a rough, ill-mannered
boy to vex her.”</p>

<p>He loved her more than ever, it appeared, but
thought her not much wiser than himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a>[Pg 235]</span></p>

<p>Her fear of the stern rules of El Islâm was tamed
by reverence.</p>

<p>“By Allah, they are like the string and we the
beads,” said Umm ed-Dahak, holding up a rosary
to point her meaning. “Thirty-three beads of
no intrinsic worth. If scattered, useless and soon
lost. If strung together, a comely instrument of
praise to God.”</p>

<p>Barakah watched Muhammad with humility; not
jealous of the change which had been wrought by
others, but choosing to regard it as a miracle direct
from Heaven. His pride, once wayward, now
was focused on his coming manhood. He told
her all his thoughts, which seemed to her most
wise. He waited on her hand and foot when in
her presence. Yet in this deference there was a
touch of condescension which was absent from the
honour which he paid to Yûsuf. His father was his
sovereign, she his tender care. Such wisdom in so
small a child appeared miraculous. She worshipped
his perfections while he bowed before her.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>


<p>At seven years old Muhammad went to school.
It was customary for the scions of great houses
to be taught at home by private tutors, but the
family council had decreed that so exceptional
a child must feel the yoke of public discipline
and mix with other boys as soon as possible.
The school, just founded by the widow of a former
ruler, was reckoned modern, for the simple reason
that the scholars learnt geography and history, and
handled other books as well as the august Corân.</p>

<p>Ghandûr led off Muhammad every morning,
and brought him home at evening through the
perils of the streets. Barakah’s thoughts were
with him all day long; she liked to guess at his
employment at a given moment; while Umm
ed-Dahak painted flattering pictures of his skill
in learning, the astonishment of all his masters
at his brilliant genius.</p>

<p>When she was driven out to pay her calls,
Barakah arranged beforehand with the eunuch
that the carriage should pull up before the school.
Then through the shutter she would watch the
iron screen which filled each window-arch and
listen to the drone of children’s voices.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a>[Pg 237]</span></p>

<p>The school was an octagonal kiosk of marble,
touching the wall of a world-famous mosque. Its
salient bulk half throttled an important thoroughfare,
forming a narrow strait where traffic battled,
and on each side a little bay or backwater where
the carriage could draw up without obstruction.
There, underneath the windows with their arabesques
of iron screen-work, sat street sorcerers
with trays of sand before them, venders of sugar-cane
and slabs of bread and divers nuts; and
holy beggars slumbered in the shade. Barakah
knew exactly where Muhammad had his seat and,
waiting upon that side, watched a certain opening in
the iron-work, from which there presently emerged
a little hand. It fluttered for a moment and was
then withdrawn. She waited for a second signal
and a third before she gave the order to drive on.</p>

<p>At school Muhammad’s aim was to excel by
all means. The counsels of Murjânah Khânum,
who used religious and inspiring words, had fired
his brain. He had but one ambition now&mdash;to
please his father. He would prove the best of
Muslims, the most zealous, the most learned, and
then his father would forget his former wickedness.
In pursuance of this end he chafed at every
obstacle and was infuriated by stupidity or sloth
in others. He beat his foster-brother more than
once through mere impatience, and in the end
put zeal into that vacant but receptive youth.
And Barakah, whose worship of her paragon ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"></a>[Pg 238]</span>tended
to the son of Ghandûr as his shadow, became
the confidante of all their thoughts and projects.</p>

<p>The report which the headmaster made to
Yûsuf Bey after Muhammad’s first few weeks at
school was satisfactory.</p>

<p>“The boy, thy son,” remarked the reverend
man, “is highly gifted and extremely diligent.
In sh´Allah, he will live to be a light to El Islâm,
a glory to this land of Masr, and a worthy slave
of the Most High. We have only one small
fault to find with his behaviour, which is that,
in his eagerness, he answers questions we address
to other boys, and is inclined to argue with the
teacher as if instruction were for him alone.”</p>

<p>His mother was delighted with this verdict,
whose one restriction seemed to her the highest
praise. She began to cherish visions of his future
greatness, and with the aid of Umm ed-Dahak
built grand castles in the air.</p>

<p>“In sh´Allah, he will rise to rule in Egypt;
he will be the right hand of the Khedive, the
chief vizier, the leader of the armies; the sword
and shield of El Islâm, the scourge of Allah on
the heathen and all infidels.”</p>

<p>Thus Umm ed-Dahak, seated on the floor
beside her mistress; who, reclining on the dais
at ease with her narghileh, removed the amber
mouthpiece from her lips to sigh, “In sh´Allah!”</p>

<p>In order to be worthy of her son’s magnificence,
Barakah had evolved a fine romantic history<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a>[Pg 239]</span>
out of her own past. The transmutation of that
dross to gold took place so naturally that she
was not aware of lying when she told her crony
that she was of royal birth. Gentility being
something inconceivable by Umm ed-Dahak, who
knew of no inherited prestige save that of an
Emîr, she was obliged, in order to convey the
status of a governess, to compare it with the lot
of fallen princes. From thence to the invention
of a principality was but a step. The remonstrance
of the Consul and of Mrs. Cameron
against her marriage became the rage of a
fanatical and angry nation. The noise of her
conversion had disturbed all Europe, and nearly
brought on a religious war. Let Umm ed-Dahak
ask the Pasha, if she doubted!</p>

<p>But Umm ed-Dahak was not of the kind who
doubt. For her, romantic fiction was more
worth than fact. She accepted this, as she accepted
every tale, artistically, and even added
likely details unperceived of Barakah.</p>

<p>The servants came to know the weakness of
their mistress and addressed her as “Emîrah”
with all kinds of ceremony. The disease was
catching; they themselves became infected. With
the blacks illusion took the form of demoniacal
possession. Each one began to brag of “him
who dwells in me,” his power and jurisdiction
over other demons. Barakah overheard them
talking of their inmates, discussing pedigrees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a>[Pg 240]</span>
and finding out relationships which had existence
only in the world of ginn. She once complained
of their insanity to Fitnah Khânum,
and asked what could be done to put a stop to it.</p>

<p>“I know one cure for devils as for every other
illness of unmarried girls, and that is matrimony,”
was the answer. “Among us here it is a sovereign
remedy; among the Franks it seems less efficacious.”</p>

<p>“Among the Franks such foolish fancies are
unknown,” laughed Barakah, when Fitnah Khânum
sniffed, but said no more.</p>

<p>“The poor one is herself possessed,” she told
Murjânah afterwards. “The servants say a
princess of the ginn inhabits her; and she complains
because they also harbour inmates. She
ought to see a proper exorcist.”</p>

<p>The ladies all agreed to pity her. But Barakah,
unconscious of their criticism, pursued her path
of dreams with Umm ed-Dahak.</p>

<p>“May fire consume the infidels who thus dethroned
thee, who robbed thee of thy land and
honours!” cried the latter. “O day of milk,
when thou didst fly for succour to the Muslimîn!
They will avenge thy wrongs, in sh´Allah, in the
time to come. Thy son shall win his birthright
back with fire and sword.... Ma sh´Allah! Do
I not behold his state? I see him on a throne,
with courtiers prone before him&mdash;Muhammad
Yûsuf Pasha, styled ‘the Great’&mdash;nay, what say
I?&mdash;the Emîr, the King Muhammad in virtue of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a>[Pg 241]</span>
his mother’s dignity!” cried Umm ed-Dahak
with dilated eyes. “By Allah, the most splendid
scene I ever witnessed! He is Grand Vizier!”</p>

<p>But the downfall of the Khedive’s favourite,
occurring at this epoch, dashed the ardour of the
seers, and caused them in alarm to change their
vision. The man, whose pomp had served them
for a measure of Muhammad’s greatness, disappeared
from life. The story ran that, having
grown too great, he had been trapped by order of
his loving master, accommodated with a weighted
sack, and dropped into the Nile. The tidings
caused a flutter in the world of women like that of
seafarers beholding shipwreck. For the favourite’s
death involved the ruin of a great harîm, boasting
its troupes of dancers and of trained musicians,
lavish of entertainment and of gay repute. Its
members, far too many to be all beloved, had, some
of them, found vent in wild amours which furnished
thrilling stories to more lucky women.
Now all the slaves were scattered among other
houses; the ladies, owning private property,
returned to their relations pending further
marriage. The great man’s children were reduced
to mediocrity; his honours and emoluments
divided up among a score of courtiers; his
name became a byword for pride’s fall.</p>

<p>“Wallahi, our beloved must not follow in his
steps too closely. Allah forbid!” said Umm ed-Dahak
solemnly. And forthwith she began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a>[Pg 242]</span>
make another forecast, with frequent “In sh´Allahs”
and “Ma sh´Allahs,” to rob it of all taint
of boastfulness. “He goes up gently, rousing
no suspicion in the ruler, winning the people’s
voice, as did Muhammad Ali. Then, when the
times are ripe, he asks the Sovereign and his
courtiers to a banquet and cuts all their throats.
Then he ascends the throne and does good deeds,
till all men praise the Maker for his rare benevolence.
And thou, his mother, wilt reside in splendid state,
and when the great ones of the English come with
gifts for thee, thou wilt spit upon them and repel
them with thy little foot. In sh´Allah!”</p>

<p>Barakah would be a widow in those days, by
Allah’s mercy. A queen, she would of course
have many lovers. Did she desire a man&mdash;one
word, and he was hers as quick as lightning! And
Umm ed-Dahak would be ever at her call to spread
the net for goodly youths and guard her secret.</p>

<p>“But I shall be too old by then!” laughed
Barakah.</p>

<p>“Please Allah, no!” cried the old woman, a
trifle vexed at being brought to earth. “Thou
wilt be still quite youthful. See thee now: what
beauty, what a youthful figure! By Allah, almost
wicked in a mother! Thou dost not grow old.”</p>

<p>In fact, her shape, though something fat, was
not ungainly, like that of younger women leading
the same life. She took no care of it, conforming
to the harîm custom for women who bear children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a>[Pg 243]</span>
to let beauty go. “The time and purpose of the
bloom is past, the fruit succeeds, more noble,”
they assured her. She saw the rarest beauties,
like Bedr-ul-Budûr, already changing into fat old
women. Compared with them she felt still young
and comely. But when, her carriage rolling on
the Gîzah road, she saw real Frankish women,
riding, driving, she felt a raddled and unwieldy hag.
There was one Englishwoman in particular who often
passed her, driving a light dog-cart with a Nubian
groom behind&mdash;straight as a lance and trim of waist,
with rosy cheeks and bright eyes under grizzled hair.
A creature of free air and open sunlight, the shuttered,
perfumed shade could not produce her like.
A jealousy near hatred stirred in Barakah.</p>

<p>One evening Yûsuf, thinking to amuse her, had
sent her with his sisters and Muhammad to the new
opera-house which the Khedive had built to please
the European visitors, and also to provide His
Highness with relays of mistresses. There, in a
harîm box behind a screen, she smoked cigarettes
and listened to what seemed mere senseless screeching
to one who had admired the voice of Tâhir.
The opera was <i>Don Giovanni</i>. Never had she
witnessed a performance so stilted, artificial, and
absurd. She quite agreed with the remarks of her
companions, who, after their first wonder at the
building and the lighted stage, yawned openly
and called it simple madness. Yet the entertainment
was no bad one to the taste of Europe, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a>[Pg 244]</span>
she knew from the applause of people in the unscreened
boxes, where barefaced, brilliant women
sat and stared about them. The mere existence
of those women there in Cairo, transgressing every
native rule of conduct, was an insult. The freshness
even of the old ones made her conscious of
decay. When the girls after the second act proposed
to go, she agreed gladly. Muhammad
screamed to stay, and had to be transported bodily
by Barakah, while one of his young aunts held her
hand upon his mouth. A very small boy at the
time, he had supposed the scene was laid in hell,
and all the hideous screams of the performers
denoted pangs of tortured infidels.</p>

<p>Muhammad, for his mother’s sake, abhorred
the English; and yet he loved his mother, who was
of that race. He reconciled these warring passions
by supposing the existence of a race of Muslims
in the British Isles.</p>

<p>One day, when he was ten years old, he came
home with a face of indignation, demanding,
“O my mother, is it not quite true that the English
nation is as strong and warlike as the French, and
nowise subject to the lord of Paris?”</p>

<p>“True, O my son.”</p>

<p>“By Allah, that is what I said. We were
arguing, a dozen of us, after school. They all
opposed me, stating that the French were much
the greater and more civilized. I, sure of my
contention, asked a master who stood by. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"></a>[Pg 245]</span>
foolishly asserted that the French were stronger.
I informed him of his error in all courtesy, when,
to my horror, he began abusing me, detained me
in the school an hour against my will, and himself
remained to gloat on my imprisonment.</p>

<p>“Nor is that all. No sooner was I free than I
went to the house of the principal and made complaint
of the injustice. He said&mdash;the malefactor!&mdash;thus
escaping from the question, that it was a sin
for true believers to quarrel for the sake of infidels.
I told him there were Muslimîn among the English,
as witness my own mother, who is one of them.
He had the rudeness to declare thou art a convert.
It was all that I could do to keep from plucking at
his beard. I shall ask my father to remove me
straightway from a school where lying insults and
oppression thus prevail.”</p>

<p>“The principal spoke truth. I am a convert,”
murmured Barakah, hanging her head through
fear of her son’s shame.</p>

<p>“Merciful Allah!” cried Muhammad, greatly
shocked.</p>

<p>But in a moment he recovered from the blow.
Kissing her hand, he murmured fondly:</p>

<p>“Be not downcast, O beloved, it is not thy fault.
My comrades sneer at converts; but no matter.
I shall still maintain that thou wert born in the
right way. Thou art still my dearest mother,
loved and honoured.”</p>

<p>The lover-like, protecting air became him rarely.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX"></a>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>


<p>News from the world of men reached the harîm
like voices from the street without. From time to
time some item, interesting them, was cried in tones
of censure or approval; but always in a manner of
abstraction. This apathy arose from centuries
of strict seclusion, in which, through change of
dynasties and strife of factions, the privilege
of the harîm had been respected. The women felt
that politics could not come near them; the
government which ruled the men was none of theirs.
A realm within the realm, they had their own
excitements, their own concerns of life and death
and amorous crime. Events the most important
failed to move them, while trifling breaches of
religion or old custom caused a vast commotion
in that nursery of fanaticism.</p>

<p>One day, when Barakah was out driving in her
carriage, she was stopped near Abdîn palace by the
pressure of excited crowds and heard the sounds
of angry tumult. The driver backed the horses
and then turned. On reaching home she asked
the eunuch of the matter.</p>

<p>He shrugged: “It is the soldiers, O my lady.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247"></a>[Pg 247]</span>
They are angry at the coming of the Frank commissioners.”</p>

<p>It was then that she presumed to question Yûsuf,
and learnt that two commissioners, one French, one
English, had come to take control of the finances of
the country. The Khedive, that jovial libertine and
spendthrift, was now bankrupt. The Europeans,
as his creditors, assumed the reins.</p>

<p>“But why the English?” questioned Barakah
with irritation, for up to then the French alone had
been a power in Egypt.</p>

<p>“Wallahi, just because their men are clever,”
was the answer. “They bought up all our
Sovereign’s shares in the canal. Their guile is great,
but greater Allah’s mercy, for the arrival of these
Franks is good for me. Knowing both their
languages I am put forward to receive them, and
so rise in honour.”</p>

<p>In fact, a few days later he was made a Pasha.</p>

<p>But Barakah could not regard the case thus
philosophically. The intrusion of the English
frightened her. If they should ever come to lord
it in the country her degradation would be unendurable.
She confided her displeasure to Muhammad,
who took an interest in politics as schoolboys will.
He bade her have no fear; the Muslims would
destroy them presently. The women told her
God would intervene. But things went rapidly
from bad to worse.</p>

<p>Since a French force under Bonaparte had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248"></a>[Pg 248]</span>
entered Cairo, before the era of Muhammad Ali,
no such fury had possessed the world of women as
that which seized them on the deposition of the
Khedive Ismaîl. Whatever touched the majesty
of El Islâm excited them; vile infidels had here
contrived the downfall of a Muslim ruler. And
there ensued a host of innovations, in which the
hand of unbelief was plainly visible.</p>

<p>The slave-trade had been formally abolished
under Ismaîl, to please the Franks, but with the
customary wink of that facetious monarch. The
trade continued gaily with his sly connivance.
Now, in his son’s reign, it began to be suppressed
in earnest. The slaves themselves were loud in
lamentation. When it was known that slavery
itself was menaced, the harîm chattered like ten
thousand angry parrots.</p>

<p>“The Lord have mercy on us! It is gross
impiety,” screamed Fitnah Khânum. “Does not
the august Corân lay down strict rules for the
control of slaves? Is it not therefore Allah’s will
that they exist?”</p>

<p>“The trade in slaves is holy,” cried Gulbeyzah;
“bringing every year a thousand converts out of
heathendom. If some are slain, it is no matter,
since the death of heathens is uncounted, like the
death of beasts. Without the cruel raids, the
bloodshed, the survivors had not known salvation.
Praise be to Allah, they cannot suppress the trade
in us white people, since a father’s right to sell his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"></a>[Pg 249]</span>
child resides in nature. Only since the English
meddle do we hear such wickedness.”</p>

<p>Besides the slave-trade, good old customs were
abolished&mdash;one ceremony called the trampling, in
particular, in which a sheykh, renowned for piety,
was wont to ride on horseback over strewn
believers. Some people thought the world was
coming to an end, and looked for the appearance of
the final prophet. The times were full of omens,
portents, monstrous births. The French and
English, in collusion, gave command in Egypt; the
monarch was a puppet in their hands. The apathy
of men amazed the women looking on. The good
Khedive appeared a devil to those hot non-combatants;
rebellion a plain duty upon all believers.
They prayed for a deliverer to be raised up; and in
the absence of the prophet whom they half expected,
applauded the exertions of a simple soldier, who
ventured to oppose the wicked rulers.</p>

<p>With the exception of some Turks, who sneered
from pride of race, the whole harîm acclaimed
Arâbi from his first appearance as a champion.
The women viewed the question very simply.
Here, on one hand, was a man who wished to free
the land from foreign interference, whose cry of
Egypt for the Egyptians, must mean Egypt for
the Muslims, since the Copts were nobody; on the
other, an infirm, if not a wicked, ruler who was
letting all the privilege of El Islâm be torn away.
In vain their men assured them the Khedive was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"></a>[Pg 250]</span>
good Muslim, and only deferential to the Franks
from sheer expediency; that Arâbi’s faction was
the work of clever rascals, and boasted not one man
of solid parts. They took religious ground and
would not listen. They taught their children
to admire Arâbi. Muhammad, now a student
in the school of war, assisted by his faithful Ali,
fought five boys who dared to ridicule the peasant
soldier. Though beaten many times the two
did not give way, though Ali, for his own part,
would have fled thrice over. But Muhammad
was indomitable. Bruised and bleeding, he returned
with fury to the charge, till his opponents
fled in pure religious terror of such dauntless rage.
A few weeks later the whole land was cringing
before Arâbi’s power. And then excitements
followed thick and fast. Muhammad brought his
mother all the latest rumours. One day it was:</p>

<p>“Great tidings, O my mother! All the Franks
are flying! Ali and I have been to watch them at
the railway station. Such a crowd! The faithful,
past all patience, have risen up at Tantah and
Iskenderîyeh and slain thousands of them.”</p>

<p>A number of the loyal Turks were also flying.
Amînah Khânum and Bedr-ul-Budûr came to take
leave of Barakah. They were bound for Alexandria,
in the train of the Khedive, and thence
would take ship for Constantinople if things grew
no better. Muhammad, when informed of their
departure, rendered praise to Allah.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"></a>[Pg 251]</span></p>

<p>“They are vanquished,” he remarked. “But
would to Allah that we had more Turks on our
side. These fellâhîn, though braggarts, are great
cowards. They need the whip to urge them into
battle. I, who am half a Turk and half an Englishman,
cannot endure the sluggishness of this Nile
mud.”</p>

<p>The boy forgot the portion of his blood which was
derived from Fitnah Khânum, his paternal grandmother.
It was Nile mud of the thickest, but it
did not show in him. All hot and noble counsels
moved him to enthusiasm; the lukewarm and the
philosophical enraged his soul. Stupidity or
insolence in an inferior he could not brook. If his
commands were not obeyed at once and with
intelligence, he struck hard with the first instrument
that came to hand, and called down Allah’s
wrath on the offender. The old Pasha was
delighted by those outbursts, as showing the
commanding spirit of his Turkish race.</p>

<p>“When all these low-born troubles have passed
over, we must procure him some small government,”
he said to Yûsuf, who acquiesced with a pathetic
smile. He had not that supreme contempt for the
Egyptian rebels which kept his aged father calm
amid the storm. He held a good position, and he
feared to lose it; whereas his father had retired
from public life.</p>

<p>Barakah delighted in her son’s account of the
disorders. His excitement and the animation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"></a>[Pg 252]</span>
each glance and gesture provided her with pictures
upon which she brooded in the vacancy of summer
days. The air which drifted through her lattice
was oppressive, the sunlight like a furnace fire
without; the voices of the street complained of
dust and heat; the ceaseless buzz of flies benumbed
the brain; the call for water rang incessantly
through all the house, and even Umm ed-Dahak
felt too weak to talk. But Barakah was happy,
since Muhammad spent much time with her,
finding her conversation more congenial to his
patriotic mood than that of Yûsuf. In his absence
she lay still and smoked, and quenched her
thirst at frequent intervals, taking scant notice
of her little daughter&mdash;the only other of her
many children who had managed to survive the
second year. Umm ed-Dahak loved the child and
schooled her privately, telling her stories of man’s
love and woman’s duty, and teaching her to pose
and ogle in the proper way. But for the rest she
was of no importance; Muhammad’s known
affection for her was her only merit.</p>

<p>One afternoon Muhammad came in with a mien
of wild excitement and, having kissed his mother’s
hand, cried out:</p>

<p>“Most dreadful news! O horror! O revenge!
The English have destroyed Iskenderîyeh with
their cruel guns! The English only, since the
French, more honourable, fled from the hateful
sight with tears of shame. Simply because the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"></a>[Pg 253]</span>
forts were being mended, and work was not relaxed
at their command. But, praise to Allah, we have
hurt them also. Quite half their fleet has been
destroyed by our brave fire. After this, we give
no quarter&mdash;no, by Allah! It is holy war.
Muhammad Tewfik is proclaimed a scoundrel. Our
Arâbi is Dictator. The army is to be augmented
fourfold by forced levies. I met a boy, no older
than myself, who goes to fight. I go this minute
to implore my father to let me likewise join the army
in the field.”</p>

<p>“Thy age is but fifteen. O Lord, he must
not go!” cried out his mother in an agony of
apprehension.</p>

<p>“I am a man full-grown, proficient in all
exercises that belong to war. As young as I are
going. Think, it is against the English, O my
mother&mdash;thy vile enemies!”</p>

<p>Embracing her without a thought for her
despair, he left her in great haste to find his
father.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX"></a>CHAPTER XXX</h2>


<p>Yûsuf Pasha was upon the point of going out
when his son was shown into his presence in his
private room. He smiled upon the stripling’s
prayer to be allowed to fight, but said:</p>

<p>“No, no, my son. Thou art too young as yet.
Wait till the war is ended and then join the fray.”</p>

<p>With that he patted the boy’s cheek, bestowed
his blessing on him, and went out, little guessing
that he left despair behind him. A carriage waited
for him at the door. An armed slave scrambled
up beside the driver. It was the hour of sunset.
Two months since the ways would have been merry
at that hour. But now the passengers were few
and fully armed; they looked suspicious and, where
groups were formed, the talk seemed guarded. A
curse had fallen on the happy city. The sunset
blushed on her high roofs, the crescent flashed on all
her spires and domes, and in the gullies which
were streets lay depths of shade; yet no one felt
the rapture of the evening.</p>

<p>Yûsuf, lolling in the carriage, gnawed his black
moustache and cursed the revolutionaries from
his heart. He had attained the wisdom which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"></a>[Pg 255]</span>
comes easily to middle age, hated disturbance and
distrusted novelty. The nervous passion which
had marked his youth still dwelt in him; but he
reserved its transports for the calls of private life;
having another wife besides the Englishwoman, and
two concubines, whom he kept in the provincial
centre whither public business often called him.
Politics had been for him a well-ruled game, on
which a man would be a fool to waste vitality.
As a functionary, he had lounged on sofas, telling
beads, dictating orders to his secretaries, at ease
except when called before superiors; until this
military rising scared his soul. Its swiftness and
success seemed downright fiendish.</p>

<p>One day a painstaking, obedient native officer
had been selected by the Khedive Ismaîl to
organize a riot hostile to the Frank commissioners.
He seemed so trusty and discreet that Ismaîl
forbore to execute him for the trifling service.
Within two years he was the idol of the native
soldiers, the spokesman of their grievances against
the foreign Turks; in five, he was the incubus
and dread of Egypt, first Minister of War and
now Dictator. That first employment recommended
him to schemers as one who did not fear
to lead rebellion. Straightforward and excitable,
extremely zealous in whatever charge he undertook,
he was thrust forward by the clever ones to posts
of hazard. His prompters, Asiatics, saw the
bounds of his intelligence and thought to keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"></a>[Pg 256]</span>
him in their hands, a priceless instrument. But
they had not allowed for the inflation of the African,
who, being once exalted, swelled and swelled until
his greatness overawed its very founders.</p>

<p>An honest man and a good Muslim, Ahmad
Arâbi lacked the cleverness of the conspirator; nor
was he one. The sordid plots which guided his
career were spun behind him; while he pressed
onward with clear brow and conquering smile&mdash;a
doomed man, in the view of calm spectators.</p>

<p>Yûsuf had known Arâbi for some years and
liked him personally; but the Khedive Muhammad
Tewfik was his friend from childhood. Entreated
by the agitators to take office with them,
he had referred the question to the good Khedive,
who begged him to accept the post thus offered,
that he (Muhammad Tewfik Pasha, Lord of
Egypt) might have one friend among his so-called
servants. Tied by his duties, he had not
fled to Alexandria with the Sovereign; but remained
behind in an absurd position, a member
of the rebel government which he abhorred. He
was now upon his way to meet some other Turks
thus stranded, to decide on some safe line of
future conduct.</p>

<p>The rendezvous was at his father’s house, where,
in the great reception-room, he found a score
of men assembled. All had the faces of conspirators
except his father, a very old man now,
who bade them welcome as to some court function.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257"></a>[Pg 257]</span></p>

<p>“Where is my son Hamdi?” asked the
patriarch upon the dais, peering round upon
the red-capped and black-coated throng.</p>

<p>“He is not with us. He has joined the fellâhîn.
He dared not tell thee,” answered Yûsuf sadly.</p>

<p>“Well, well,” remarked Muhammad Pasha,
with benignity. “Boys will be foolish! In
Allah’s name I bid you welcome, O my friends.
It is well known that I myself despise these
upstarts and have told their leader my opinion
to his face. Less old, I should have spent my
life and fortune for the young Khedive, whose
ancestor, the great Muhammad Ali, raised my
house to honour; as it is, I pray to God to grant
him victory. But his dependence on the English
likes me not; and God forbid that I should
influence your counsels. You have, each one,
his life and fortune to protect, his duty to decide
towards El Islâm.”</p>

<p>He stopped, and an uneasy silence reigned
for quite a minute. It was broken by a man
exclaiming, “They have set up a tribunal in
each town with power to ruin or to kill a man
on mere suspicion. Hear the wording of a
document which I received this day.”</p>

<p>With that, he took a paper from his breast
and read aloud its contents&mdash;a call in truculent,
inflated language upon the patriot Mahmûd
the son of Hâfiz to show his fervour by a contribution
to the war fund; failing which, he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258"></a>[Pg 258]</span>
be prosecuted as a foe to Egypt&mdash;“for the public
safety.”</p>

<p>“Aha!” laughed the old Pasha in his thin,
cracked voice. “A French model, by my beard!
For men who would eschew all foreign influence!
That is the hand of Tulbah, not Arâbi. The
mountebanks! The silly children&mdash;apish imitators!”</p>

<p>“By your Excellency’s leave the matter is
extremely serious&mdash;for me at least,” groaned
out the owner of the notice.</p>

<p>“Thou wilt make the contribution?” inquired
Yûsuf.</p>

<p>“Better flee,” remarked another.</p>

<p>And then they all began to talk together in
low whispers with frightened glances round the
room, for spies were everywhere. Flight was
now hopeless, every one agreed; nothing remained
but to feign ardour in Arâbi’s cause, give up
communication with the loyalists at Alexandria,
and pray for the usurper’s overthrow.</p>

<p>“They cannot last, I tell you,” chuckled the
old Pasha. “These fellâhîn are quite unfit for
government. The young Khedive has been too
kind. He has not whipped them. My son and I
were present when his father warned him to execute
these men, his creatures, who had tasted power.
A sad mistake, by Allah! For, Allah knows,
we do not want the English in this land. My
life-work, that of all the old diplomatists, has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259"></a>[Pg 259]</span>
been to stave off European interference, by
compliments, by guile, by small concessions.
O Allah, let me die before the evil day! The
Lord preserve us from the domination of the
infidels!”</p>

<p>The old man dropped his hands and hung his
head.</p>

<p>“Better the English than this present anarchy,”
another murmured. “Already the whole land
is overrun by gangs of brigands. The streets
here in the capital grow dangerous. There is
no order kept except among the soldiers. All
trade, all enterprise is at a standstill, and every
public undertaking goes to ruin. Already all
the people hate Arâbi.”</p>

<p>“The Lord deliver us,” said Yûsuf, “from
him and from the English both. A dreadful
quandary!”</p>

<p>When he went forth to his carriage, still in
waiting, he told his slave to have his pistols
ready, and himself examined the revolver which
he carried. He wrapped a shawl about his
face to pass unrecognized and, thus protected
and disguised, drove through the darkling streets,
where every wayfarer betrayed the like anxiety.
Only the street-dogs went about their work as
usual, prowling along the walls in search of offal.</p>

<p>At his own door a man accosted him. It
was one of his paid spies. He led the way across
the hall into his private room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260"></a>[Pg 260]</span></p>

<p>“What news?” he questioned.</p>

<p>“May Allah turn it to thy good!” the spy replied,
with his profoundest reverence. “I have
it from a member of the new Committee that your
Highness is marked down as a suspected notable.
They say it may mean destitution, even death.”</p>

<p>“I thank thee,” murmured Yûsuf and dismissed
the man. Directly he was gone he called
Ghandûr and said:</p>

<p>“Didst thou not tell me, O beloved, that thou
hadst some relative a member of the new Committee
for the Public Safety?”</p>

<p>“Yes, O my lord! The person is my father’s
brother, a small merchant.”</p>

<p>“Where is their place of meeting?”</p>

<p>“I can show it thee.”</p>

<p>“Do they meet every day?”</p>

<p>“I think so, but will ascertain.”</p>

<p>“Good. I shall wait upon them in the morning.
At daybreak take ten pounds out of the
treasury and carry it to thy relation to bespeak
his favour.”</p>

<p>“Has aught untoward happened?”</p>

<p>“Untoward? Listen!” Yûsuf told the story.</p>

<p>“Merciful Allah! How can such things be?”
exclaimed Ghandûr. “We are the greatest in
the land, they&mdash;filthy upstarts. How much does
my good lord propose to give?”</p>

<p>“A thousand pounds were not too much to save
my life.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261"></a>[Pg 261]</span></p>

<p>“Deign but to hear my counsel! Give a
hundred and ask leave for thy son to join the
army. He is prostrated by thy late refusal. His
going will prove more than any gift of money that
thy heart is with the cause&mdash;which, Allah knows,
may be the right one, since our lord has chosen to
put trust in infidels. His mother even wishes it,
to heal his chagrin. She sent for me and asked me
to entreat your Excellency. We have good friends
within the army who will see that he is kept from
fighting. My son shall go along with him, to be
his servant.”</p>

<p>Ghandûr, the simple creature, was in tears.</p>

<p>“By Allah, I will think about it,” murmured
Yûsuf.</p>

<p>Five minutes later he repaired to his son’s room,
revived the lad, and passing thence to the haramlik,
told Barakah that her request was granted. She was
half stunned, for she had counted on his obduracy.</p>

<p>Not noticing her dazed condition, for his mind
ran still on puzzles of diplomacy, he added:</p>

<p>“Thou, who art English, O my sweet one,
inform me of that nation! Are they harsh as
conquerors? What is their custom with regard
to vengeance? Do they burn and ravish, or
merely punish those who have borne arms against
them? It is important I should know beforehand
if they win the day.”</p>

<p>Barakah stared at him vaguely for a moment;
then bursting into tears, exclaimed:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262"></a>[Pg 262]</span></p>

<p>“Cut short thy life! O most unfeeling father!
O appalling prospect! I would sooner die a
thousand deaths than see them conquer.”</p>

<p>“Merciful Allah, are they so fanatical?” gasped
Yûsuf, with a face of great dismay. “I meant
not to alarm thee, O beloved. I was thinking only
of myself, how to behave in case things happened
so, which God forbid!”</p>

<p>But Barakah thought only of their son.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXI" id="CHAPTER_XXXI"></a>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>


<p>“A splendid victory at Kafr ed-Dowâr! A
thousand infidels dispatched to Hell, and not a
single blessed martyr gone to Paradise!” cried
Umm ed-Dahak, entering her lady’s presence on a
summer evening. “Ghandûr has got the news-sheet,
and craves leave to read it to thee.”</p>

<p>The lady ordered him to be admitted instantly.
Muhammad and his servant Ali were at Kafr ed-Dowâr.
Drawing her head-veil so as to leave one eye
visible, she listened to the short triumphant notice,
which began and ended with “the praise to Allah!”</p>

<p>“The praise to Allah truly!” she suspired. “Not
one was killed.”</p>

<p>Ghandûr assured her then, as he had done a score
of times, that Muhammad, with the blessing of the
Highest, ran no danger. By arrangement with the
leaders he was kept at work in the trenched camp,
away from fighting. But her anxiety was not
allayed, her boy was venturesome and, burning as
he was to fight, might break through rules.</p>

<p>Every evening in Arâbi’s journal there was
news of some fresh triumph, either at Kafr ed-Dowâr,
by Alexandria, or on the banks of the
Canal, where the main force of the English was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264"></a>[Pg 264]</span>
now operating. She heard it said on all hands
that the war would soon be over. Yet, though
every one abounded in exultant phrases, no single
soul appeared exceptionally cheerful; and she
herself did not disguise her sorrow. The absence
of Muhammad was a constant pain. She gave
attention to her little daughter fitfully.</p>

<p>The weather was intensely hot, the town a
desert full of dismal noises. So many men had
been compelled to join the army, so many beasts
of burden had been pressed for transport purposes,
that trade was paralysed and traffic almost
ceased. When she drove out, the aspect of the
streets dismayed her; it was as if the city had
been ravaged by a pestilence. The European,
Syrian, Armenian quarters were utterly deserted,
all the houses closed; and elsewhere there was
very little movement. In other summers the
harîm had gone into the country, and Barakah
would gladly have drawn nearer to the seat of
war; but her husband vetoed the proposal instantly,
the country districts were unsafe and
overrun by brigands. Yûsuf was irritable in those
days. He had his bed in the selamlik and seldom
could spare time to visit Barakah.</p>

<p>“I believe he has another woman somewhere,”
she told Umm ed-Dahak in a hopeless tone.</p>

<p>“It is his right, by Allah,” answered the old
woman; “and no slight to thee, if thou wouldst
view it fairly, and throw aside the silly fiction of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265"></a>[Pg 265]</span>
the Franks. It is the nature of a man to have
more wives than one, and a woman should no
more resent his doing so&mdash;always provided he does
not defraud her&mdash;than blame a cat for having
several kittens at a birth. Ibrahîm, the father of
the faithful, Mûsa&mdash;all the prophets till the crown
of them (God bless and save him) married more
than one. Polygamy was in the customs of the
Jews and Christians until they fell away from
El Islâm. Nay, a remembrance of it still exists
among the Franks. For do not their religious
women dwell together in one house, obedient to a
rule like ours, attired like us, and call themselves&mdash;I
ask pardon of the Lord&mdash;Harîm Allah
(the wives of God)? Rank blasphemy, by Allah!
Yet it shows that the old rule is not entirely lost.”</p>

<p>Barakah was too disconsolate to be contentious.
Let Muhammad but return to her in safety and she
would not care though Yûsuf took a thousand wives;
but in his absence everything seemed grievous.</p>

<p>A real sorrow overhung the house of Yûsuf; for
the old Pasha was fast sinking to the grave. Hamdi,
the hot disciple of Arâbi, the poet of rebellion,
author of the famous calls to patriotism which
were printed every week in the official journal,
was bowed down by grief. He thought his siding
with the malcontents had killed his father.</p>

<p>“But what was I to do?” he asked of Barakah,
to whom, as an old friend, he took his troubles.
“Their cries had fired my spirit. I could not keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266"></a>[Pg 266]</span>
silent. Na’imah tells me not to worry, yet I feel
most guilty.”</p>

<p>Yûsuf, too, was downcast and repentant.</p>

<p>“We have been like fools,” he sighed, “wasting
in vanity the precious hours we might have spent
with him&mdash;as if we thought that he would live for
ever. Now the end draws near, we can but beat
our breasts and curse our folly.”</p>

<p>When Barakah went to the old palace to inquire,
she was struck by the despairing looks of all the
servants. A eunuch with a very woeful smile
conducted her to Fitnah Khânum, who exclaimed
at sight of her:</p>

<p>“The praise to Allah, thou art come! Our
lord has asked for thee. Murjânah was just going
to dispatch a messenger. Come! Come at once!
There is no time to lose. He has refused to take
a potion which I had prepared. He will not let a
charm be hung upon him. He resigns his life to
Allah. It is the end.”</p>

<p>Murjânah Khânum sat beside the bed, holding
the old man’s hand. About the walls crouched
many black-robed women, waiting in silence, like
a flock of vultures.</p>

<p>“Here is the wife of Yûsuf,” said Murjânah,
giving place to Barakah.</p>

<p>The Pasha spoke in French. His voice was faint.</p>

<p>“Madame,” he said, “I am about to die, and I
am glad to be allowed to say adieu to you. Very
often have I thought of you and of your life among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267"></a>[Pg 267]</span>
us. I feel a very grave responsibility. I trust
that you have been, upon the whole, content?”</p>

<p>Barakah declared herself quite happy, and he
said, “Thank God!”</p>

<p>“But you will not leave us yet; you will
recover,” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>“No, no, my cherished daughter. My last
hour has sounded. I have lived to see my life-work
all undone. The Christians always sought a
war with El Islâm. We kept a calm face under
insults, even made concessions, as one gives a rabid
dog a stick to worry.” For a moment the worn
face resumed its light of humour. “But now the
war has come.... Those rash fanatics!...”</p>

<p>There rose a murmur in the room.</p>

<p>“The Grand Mufti comes,” announced Murjânah
Khânum.</p>

<p>“Forgive me, dear madame. It is an old and
cherished friend,” the dying man suspired, with a
faint smile. “Adieu! Adieu!”</p>

<p>And Barakah, with all the women save Murjânah
Khânum, hurried out into the passage. At the
door a tall and stately man brushed past her. His
head was so erect beneath the massive turban, his
long robe fell so straight from well-squared shoulders,
that it astonished her to see his beard as white as
snow. He passed into the room. The door was shut.</p>

<p>A minute later, Murjânah Khânum uttered a loud
cry; the Mufti came forth sobbing, with head bowed;
the black-cowled women scurried shrieking to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268"></a>[Pg 268]</span>
death-room, where they instantly began the dance of
death. They leapt and pirouetted, waving arms above
their heads, with frenzied cries. Barakah was gazing
horror-stricken at the sight, when some one took
her hand and whispered, “Come away!”</p>

<p>It was Murjânah.</p>

<p>“I cannot bear these customs,” she confessed.
“The women of the country keep them in defiance
of religion. It is useless to protest; one has to
suffer. I am very tired, my dear; for I have not
slept for many nights. Indeed, my weariness and
grief are such that I can hardly look for rest save
in the grave.”</p>

<p>Barakah took coffee in Murjânah’s room, and
tried to comfort her. She too was sad. But
her despair was turned to joy when that same
day Muhammad rushed into her arms. He had
been called by telegram. She held him back
from her and gazed at him until he blushed and
hung his head. The uniform, the high-crowned
fez, the sword, the snowy gloves, embellished him.
When she had gazed her fill, she made him tell her
of the camp, his friends, his duties; and, started
on that theme, he talked for hours.</p>

<p>“If only I could be transferred to the Canal!” he
sighed. “That is the real centre of the war. The
fighting where I am is empty show, and I am kept
from taking part in it. Day after day, I have to
teach recruits, dull fellâhîn, who know not right
from left. Instruction seems to make them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269"></a>[Pg 269]</span>
stupider. I beat and beat them, till my arm aches.
By my sword and valour, I could often kill them!
Think, O my mother!&mdash;El Islâm is menaced, armed
infidels have set foot in our land, and these men,
Muslims, will not learn their exercises!”</p>

<p>His mother laughed at his impetuosity. She
told his grandfather’s last words to her, and how
he feared the English would take hold of Egypt.</p>

<p>“There is no fear of that, in sh´Allah!” cried
Muhammad. “Our faithful host will sweep them
off like fleas. I wish I had been there to reassure
the dear one. May Our Lord have mercy on him!”</p>

<p>The funeral of Muhammad Pasha Sâlih was
among the greatest ever known, although the town
was empty. The harassed population flocked to
pay respect to one who had denounced Arâbi&mdash;a
demonstration which could not be punished since
sons of the dead man&mdash;nay, half his family&mdash;acclaimed
the tyrant. In the front of the procession
were led sheep and bullocks to be slaughtered
at the tomb, their meat distributed among the
needy in the name of the deceased. Then came
hired chanters of the Corân, then half the male
inhabitants of Cairo, walking, flanked by two thin
lines of soldiers, then the male relations, then a
choir of boys shrieking an ode in honour of the
Prophet. Immediately behind these moved the
lidless coffin, carried on men’s shoulders, with its
coloured pall, and then the females of the family
in shuttered carriages. A crowd of black-cowled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270"></a>[Pg 270]</span>
women of the city, whose wailing sounded bird-like
in the open air, brought up the rear.</p>

<p>The train, a mile long, wound out in the blinding
sunlight over the sandhill to the city of the dead,
from which at its approach the kites and crows
went up, affrighted. There ensued a period of
forced inaction, which to Barakah in the haramlik at
the mausoleum seemed interminable. The ceaseless
chanting in the tomb, the wailing of the crowd outside,
attacked her nerves. Muhammad was to leave
again that evening, and every minute she was parted
from him seemed an hour. He was kept upon the
men’s side of the tomb; nor would she see him till
they reached the house again; she had first to drive
home in the stuffy carriage with Na´imah and two
of the late Pasha’s daughters. It was maddening.</p>

<p>In fact, she saw him only for a moment, ere he
ran to catch his train. She wept a little at the
disappointment, but his visit had relieved her of a
weight of sorrow. She had only to dispatch a
telegram and he would come again. Moreover,
she was now quite certain he was not in danger.</p>

<p>When told by Yûsuf that her drives must cease,
because the horses had been taken for the army,
she did not complain, but hired a donkey when she
had to pay a call; nor could the prospect of a
famine frighten her. Her mind had rest. Each evening
brought the news of an Egyptian victory. The
English would be driven out. Her son was safe. Once
more she joked and dreamt with Umm ed-Dahak.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXII" id="CHAPTER_XXXII"></a>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>


<p>At Kafr ed-Dowâr Muhammad was kept drilling
conscripts, relieving older officers who were required
for actual fighting. Almost every day he
heard the boom of cannon, the stirring noises
of attack and skirmish; and often in his leisure
moments he would perch in some high nook and
watch the flashes, the white puffs of smoke, dispersed
upon the green of level fields between the
sea-coast sandhills and the lake&mdash;a pretty sight.
Beyond the plain of water skimmed by white-winged
birds the town of Alexandria basked in
sunlit haze. Upon the land-plain doves were
wheeling round deserted villages, kites and vultures
hovered high in air. Franks from the seaport
rode out in the rearward of the English troops, and
from the vantage-point of dykes and hillocks
watched the operations through their field-glasses.
The assaults, as he had told his mother, were not
serious; mere “fantaziyeh” the old soldiers
called them. The aim of the assailants was to
keep a portion of Arâbi’s troops from joining the
main army on the banks of the Canal, where war
was being waged in bitter earnest. Muhammad
fretted at his dull employment. The atmosphere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272"></a>[Pg 272]</span>
of strife, the bugle-calls, the march of men,
no longer satisfied him as at first. He wished
to fight, and begged the general-in-chief, who
favoured him, being a close friend of his uncle
Hamdi, to move him to some post of danger. The
great one laughed and patted him upon the back.</p>

<p>“We cannot spare thee yet from the recruits,”
he said. “That work is useful, and it must be done.
Think, thou hast given us a thousand soldiers, none
like them for rigidity and speed of motion.”</p>

<p>Muhammad hated the recruits, who still were
driven in by hundreds every day&mdash;men past their
prime, and boys dragged from the wretched villages,
and active rogues caught hiding in some ditch or
patch of cane. The land had been already drained;
the dregs were called for. And they were stupid,
dazed, those fellâhîn; a flock of sheep has more
intelligence! Muhammad, for whom soldiering
was a religion and every detail of the drill had
sanctity, was driven frantic by their apathy, their
foolish stare. Dancing with fury, he reviled their
mothers and beat them with his cane about the ears.</p>

<p>“By the Prophet, they are pigs!” he told the son
of Ghandûr, who served him in his tent and hung
upon his every word. “Here is El Islâm in
danger; they are Muslims; yet they yawn and
gape if asked to hold a gun. Ah! if I had a
hundred Turks instead of them!”</p>

<p>The son of Ghandûr, who to please Muhammad
would himself have put his head into a canno<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273"></a>[Pg 273]</span>n’s
mouth, was horrified at the behaviour of the
conscripts. That they could fail to see the light
of inspiration on Muhammad’s brow was proof
sufficient of their utter baseness. For the same
reason he despised the generals. Muhammad was
more gifted for command than they, and yet they
kept him ever at this menial task. Had Muhammad&mdash;or
his foster-brother even&mdash;owned the
leadership, Iskenderîyeh would long since have
fallen, and all the English have been pushed into the
sea. He dared to proffer this opinion to his lord one
evening. But Muhammad in his wisdom answered:</p>

<p>“No, we cannot take the town, for this good
reason, that a portion of their fleet, unseen from
here, commands it, and would pour in shells to our
destruction.”</p>

<p>Ali received this information with head bowed
and thanks to God. He prayed the Maker of the
World to put some mind in the recruits in order that
they too might profit by such high instruction.</p>

<p>It was usual at that time for officers to handle
soldiers roughly on parade, caning them upon the
head and shoulders, kicking them, and heaping on
them every species of abuse. Muhammad might
be called indulgent as commanders went; but he
was over-much in earnest. His outbreaks lacked
the touch of humour which endears. Old soldiers
might have borne them with a laugh for the sake
of his enthusiasm, which was very evident.</p>

<p>But these were men who had been driven from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274"></a>[Pg 274]</span>
their homes like cattle, at the goad’s point. For
days they had been herded up in pens in a provincial
town, and there harangued by holy men and
maddened by religious shouting till they lost what
little wits remained to them and hardly knew a
true believer from an infidel. Arâbi had proclaimed
the golden age; yet here they were imprisoned,
hounded, driven, and now subjected to
the cuffs and insults of a shameless boy. Huddling
together, they looked on with lowered brows, too
scared to understand what the young Turk was
shouting. Arâbi had proclaimed the Turks
abolished. Where was reason? They gave forth
inarticulate harsh cries like frightened beasts.</p>

<p>Each squad Muhammad handled seemed more
stupid than the last&mdash;so stupid that one early
morning an inspecting general advised him, laughing,
to give drill a rest, and take them to the
trenches; they were used to digging.</p>

<p>Muhammad felt the order as a whip-cut; he was
furious. The general despised his work as an
instructor, whereas God knew what trouble he had
taken. It was all their fault. In the trenches
he allowed them to do nothing right, but shrieked
out contradictory orders emphasized by slashes of
his cane. Slowly it dawned on them that he was
quite alone; the place was hidden by high banks
from supervision.</p>

<p>The daily pageant of attack was then in progress.
The crackle of a volley came from no great dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275"></a>[Pg 275]</span>tance.
Muhammad implored Allah to direct the
bullets so as to kill them all, for they were worse
than infidels. He did not notice the changed
manner of their breathing, nor the new fire which
smouldered in their eyes.</p>

<p>At a blow across the face, accompanied by
frightful insults, a burly fellow seized Muhammad’s
wrists and deftly tripped him. The boy lay on
his back bereft of speech. His captor knelt
upon his belly, while the others crowded round
like cattle interested. He could feel their breath.</p>

<p>“Hear, O my little son! Swear by the Sayyid
Ahmad to be civil. It were best for thee.”</p>

<p>Muhammad, with his pride undaunted, answered:
“Sinful hog! I swear to have thee
thrashed with the nailed whip and then decapitated.
O Muslimîn! Do you not know that this
is mutiny, an awful crime?”</p>

<p>“Then we must finish him,” remarked his
captor, with a sigh. “With his own sword!
Here! Quickly, while I stop his screeching.”</p>

<p>The speaker pressed his hand down on Muhammad’s
mouth, while another drew the sword and
plunged it several times into the prostrate form.
They watched until the last convulsions ceased;
then piously observed: “Our Lord have mercy
on him! There is no power nor might save in
Allah, the High, the Tremendous!”</p>

<p>“By Allah, he could bite!” observed his first
assailant, shaking blood from his right hand. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276"></a>[Pg 276]</span>
palm was bitten through. He stopped to bandage it;
and then they made a litter with their spades and
so conveyed the body back to camp with wailing.</p>

<p>“The darling of our souls is dead,” they chanted.
“Slain by the infidels, whom we repulsed. Our
brother, Abdul Câder, too, is wounded in the hand.”</p>

<p>The lie was quite transparent, yet it passed unquestioned.
The high commanders shrugged and let
it go. There were a hundred men concerned, with
Allah knew how many sympathizers. They dreaded
a stampede of all the conscripts in the camp.</p>

<p>When Ali, mad with grief, demanded justice,
he was told to hold his tongue. The general was
profoundly grieved; he shed some tears, and
swore that every honour should be paid to the
remains. A telegram was sent to Yûsuf Pasha
announcing that his son had died a martyr, and
that the blessed body was upon its way to Cairo.
Within an hour of death it had been dressed for
burial. It was carried in a fine procession to the
railway, where a special train&mdash;a locomotive and
an open truck&mdash;was waiting. The corpse was
laid down in the truck, and covered with some
tent-cloth; and Ali sat beside it, while the train
sped hooting on past empty villages, where only
a few children played upon the dust-heaps, a
few women stood in doorways with hands shading
eyes, past palm-groves and the fields of cotton
and of sugar-cane until the citadel rose up before
him in the evening sky.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>


<p>The news was broken gently to the stricken
mother. Yûsuf, overcoming his own grief, came
in at noon and sat an hour with her, leading
her up by little steps to view the glory that their
son had died a martyr for the Faith. When the
announcement came at length, the fortitude he
had assumed gave way. He wept profusely.
But Barakah was tearless. She sat rigid, with
pale eyes staring vaguely in a face of stone. She
asked that Ali, as soon as he arrived, might
be sent in to her; and that was all. Umm ed-Dahak
came and mumbled on her hand, moaning
endearments which she did not hear. Then Ali
was announced. At the same instant dreadful
wailing filled the house. She drew her head-veil
round her face (the movement had become instinctive)
when he fell before her, pouring forth
his awful story, concluding with the words:
“The funeral sets forth this minute, O my lady.
His body will not keep with all those wounds.”</p>

<p>And then her anguish passed the bounds of
suffering; she moved and looked and spoke, but
felt no more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278"></a>[Pg 278]</span></p>

<p>Her women, half demented, danced around
her. They tore their flesh with finger-nails, defiled
their faces, and raised an endless chant, reviewing
all the charms and virtues of the dear one, his
mother’s love, the blackness of the world, each
verse concluding with a shriek of “O calamity!”
It was the triumph-song of death.</p>

<p>Robbed of the corpse, the funeral over, they
thronged her chamber, keeping up the ghastly
round, the death-chant, in the hope to give her
tears. Her petrifaction filled them with dismay.
To women who accept with rapture all life’s
chances, whose custom is to celebrate each blow
that strikes them and magnify it as a witness to
the power of God, her stony apathy appeared
uncanny. They increased their efforts, while
Umm ed-Dahak poured into her ear a song of
memory designed to loose the frozen fountain of
despair.</p>

<p>“She was the fairest daughter of the seed of
Adam. See her now! Her feet, her finger-tips
dropped perfume. She had the grace of flowers,
the voice of turtles. Now behold her! In a
moment blind and deaf and dumb and paralyzed.
And why? Alas, O thou who askest! it is
because the sunshine of her life is fled. We
saw her follow his dead body to the grave. As
the cow pursues the calf that has been reft from
her, so did she follow blindly with a noise of
lowing. She has not even strength to beat her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279"></a>[Pg 279]</span>
face. Her breath is painful, husky like the voice
of doves; its sound is all the sobbing of the
childless mother. Say, O beloved, what is in
thy mind? Dost thou remember his tarbûsh,
his yellow slippers, the loveliness of all that
touched his body, which was perfumed amber?
There was a little mole upon his breast well
known to thee. O Allah, waken memory, or
grief will slay her!”</p>

<p>Barakah saw and heard as in a trance. She
thought herself in Hell, bound fast and gagged
while devils taunted her. She was tortured
by the memory of English winter evenings, of
walking back from church in the long train of
orphans, the patter of their feet resounding
sadly. That dreariness appeared a state of bliss
compared with this luxurious life enclosed in
heat. She longed for a cold wind, with rain in it.
Remembrance of a garden under sunset came
to her; she saw once more a cool verandah with
long windows open on an English drawing-room,
and heard the earnest voice of Mrs. Cameron
entreating her to stay and save her soul. This
was God’s punishment. Her life from then till
now had been all frowardness and self-indulgence.
While basking in it she had been aware that
it was baneful. A thousand awful faces rose
to sneer, “We warned you!” The glimpses
she had had of horrid depths, the scenes of bloodshed
and the tales of cruelty, seemed now emphatic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280"></a>[Pg 280]</span>
warnings of this end. She had sunk downward
till she had no faith nor virtue more than beasts
have. Her all was in her son, whom God had
killed. Crushed, maimed, defrauded, she was
flung upon the earth, the scorn of men and angels
and the sport of fiends.</p>

<p>As by degrees her sense returned to her, she
looked about her with strange eyes and tried to
think. But every effort was a sword that pierced
her heart. One morning, peering dully through
her lattice, she saw a gay pavilion in the yard, and
leading to it rows of masts with lanterns hung
between. They were erected for the meytam, or
reception for the dead. She had seen them often
when she visited great houses; but now her mind
attached no meaning to them. It was two hours
later, in the middle of the function, that her sense
returned. A mighty gust of grief, a cry of “O
calamity!” swept through the crowd of black-clad
women in her great reception-room. It
roused her mind. She saw, and was alarmed.
What was she doing? What was all this crowd
of people? Were they human?</p>

<p>The great saloon was full of women. The
ladies sat up on the dais with flourished handkerchiefs,
beating their breasts, their faces, at
each burst of woe. Dependants crouched upon
the ground and rocked incessantly, with foaming
lips. Some faces wore a hideous fixed grin; some
mouthed continually. The hired performers stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281"></a>[Pg 281]</span>
and chanted with obscene contortions, or squatted
on a mat and wailed in chorus. The words “O my
calamity,” recurring in a sort of running chant
without coherence, shook the assembly like a
tempest-blast. And all the while dainties were
being handed round by weeping servants, and
accepted by the mourners as fresh cause for
grief.</p>

<p>An ague of intense repugnance seized on Barakah.
She felt that she must fly from this inferno, must
keep the hope of flight before her resolutely, or
her soul was lost. It was as if a hostile hand compressed
her throat. She struggled, was determined
to get free. Towards that end she battled with
instinctive cunning.</p>

<p>After the meytam, when she seemed exhausted,
her brain, enamoured of this hope, was planning
madly.</p>

<p>“Take heart, O moon of moons,” the servants
told her. “In sh´Allah thou shalt bring forth
sons instead of him.”</p>

<p>She strove to smile.</p>

<p>Her resolution was to leave her husband and
her little daughter, the comfortable house, the
easy life, to stray alone and homeless, back to
Christian lands. There she would enter some
religious order, and spend the residue of life in
prayer for Muslims.</p>

<p>Every one was kind. The tender sympathy of
Yûsuf, though himself hard stricken, might well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282"></a>[Pg 282]</span>
have won her heart had she possessed one. Her
heart was dead and buried in the grave. The
ladies and her servants tried at first to cheer her;
but when they found their efforts useless, let her
be. Only Umm ed-Dahak remained with her
constantly. Discreet as ever, she kept silence for
long hours, watching her mistress with a doleful
mow. They thought her too depressed to take a
step unaided, had not the least suspicion of her
wish to flee. It was, besides, a time of national
anxiety, when every one who could went out to
seek the news, and those imprisoned listened to
the noises of the street.</p>

<p>One day, in the full heat of noon, when men are
sleepy, she sent out the old woman on an errand;
and went and kissed her child, Afîfah, who was
fast asleep. Then, having made sure that the
slave-girls were not moving, she returned to her
own room and donned a common habbarah, which
she had sometimes worn when she went out with
Umm ed-Dahak. From the store of money Yûsuf
had entrusted to her she took sufficient to defray
her fare to France, and hung it in a bag around her
neck.</p>

<p>Thus furnished, she stole out through the
selamlik hall. No eunuch challenged; the doorkeeper
was snoring on his couch within the entry.
Beside him lay the best part of a water-melon.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>


<p>Barakah had not made many steps outside the
house before she was completely lost. Although for
sixteen years her home had been in Cairo, she had
never walked in the streets before. Which was the
way? She could not tell, but went on bravely, hoping
for some guide. At last she met a donkey-driver
with a pleasant face. In answer to her timid hail,
he smiled delighted and praised his Maker for the
honour of her patronage. “To the railway station,”
she enjoined at mounting, and he answered “Ready!”</p>

<p>Away they went, arousing echoes in the stony
alleys, the driver shouting as he ran beside the
ambling beast. Barakah felt exhilarated by the
change of motion, the little spice of danger when
they dashed round corners, or charged some group
of wayfarers with warning cries. The first stage
of her flight would soon be over; and once on
board the train, she thought, escape was sure.</p>

<p>The streets were empty even for that hour.
Scavenger dogs slept undisturbed in every spot of
shade. The persons they encountered seemed to have
no business, but stood about in groups conversing
glumly. On the wide, dusty square before the railway
station groups were many. A little crowd beset<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284"></a>[Pg 284]</span>
the station doors. These were all closed, to Barakah’s
amazement. The building looked deserted.</p>

<p>“Ask when the next train starts for the sea-coast,”
she ordered her attendant, who addressed
a shout to persons standing near.</p>

<p>“The sea-coast? Allah knows! It may be
never!” The reply was shrugged. “A great
fight has taken place. The end has come. The
English fell upon the camp at daybreak&mdash;yesterday
or this morning, Allah knows! The rebel
army was dispersed like chaff. The leader&mdash;the
arch-traitor&mdash;escaped hither on an engine, and is
in the town now somewhere, herding with his kind.
It is clearly seen how foully he deceived us, seducing
us from our allegiance with the promise of success.”</p>

<p>“Praise be to Allah that his reign is ended,”
said another. “If the English were but true
believers, one would bless them.”</p>

<p>“Nay, the tidings are not certain,” cried a third
with anguish.</p>

<p>“As certain as the sun is hot upon my reins
this minute. I have it from a man who saw Arâbi.
The rascal’s face was yellow as a corpse.”</p>

<p>Barakah’s mind received no more than the initial
statement. The way that she had meant to take
was closed against her.</p>

<p>“Whither, my lady?” asked the donkey-boy,
with willing smile.</p>

<p>“Far, far away&mdash;towards the sea-coast. Anywhere!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285"></a>[Pg 285]</span></p>

<p>“Ready!” he laughed. “It is for thee to order.
By Allah, we will go to Gebel Câf if thou desire it.”</p>

<p>He smote his donkey, and they jogged along
once more, out through new suburbs to the open
fields. The sun was an armed foe, the dust a
persecutor; her habbarah and face-veil made a
sheath of fire. The donkey-boy kept looking at
her with compassion, smiling encouragement whenever
he could meet her gaze. He thought her
mad, and so indulged her fancy, assuring her that
it would not take long to reach the sea. But when
she murmured of the heat and wished to rest, he
showed immense relief.</p>

<p>“That is the best,” he cried. “Wait till I find
some pleasant shade for thee. See, yonder is a
tree. There thou shalt rest till the great heat is
past, and then, at thy command, we can resume
the journey.”</p>

<p>Dismounting under leaves, she sank upon the
ground and wept despairingly. The tears, which
bitter grief had failed to wring from her, flowed
freely for her impotence. Escape was hopeless.
Her project now appeared the last absurdity.
The change of clothes, the change of manners, now
presented difficulties which she felt that she would
never have the strength to overcome. The donkey-boy’s
consoling words, his friendly grin, were
teasing. She sent him to fetch water from a
village near at hand. He came back with a
pitcher and two slabs of bread; which so revived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286"></a>[Pg 286]</span>
her spirit that she once more saw beyond the
moment and conceived a plan.</p>

<p>She would wait till nightfall and then seek the
city of the dead, to die on her son’s grave, if Allah
willed it. At least she would spend all the night
in prayer imploring Allah’s mercy for him in the
name of Christ.</p>

<p>She had sat a long while, cross-legged, gazing
straight before her, her hands locked in her lap,
when a soft voice disturbed her. The donkey-boy
was plucking at her sleeve.</p>

<p>“The heat is spent,” he told her. “Best be
moving! It is back into the city,&mdash;not so?&mdash;thy
command? Much better than to journey to the sea,
like this, without provision. Say, which way?”</p>

<p>Barakah pointed a direction listlessly. She had
no wish to enter Cairo before dark, so chose a long
way round, among the fields.</p>

<p>Soon the sunset reddened all the plain, stretching
their shadows far before them on the dyke.
The citadel upon its height was hotly flushed one
minute, the next ash-grey and lifeless like a skull.
It lived in her imagination as a monstrous spider
which held her with its web and drew her in.</p>

<p>The donkey-boy beside her prattled ceaselessly.</p>

<p>“O lady, I will not forsake thee&mdash;no, by the
Prophet, never, till thy mind is healed. Do I
know the cemetery El Afîfi? Wallahi! I can
guide thee thither. Not a bad idea; for Allah comforts
those who visit the deceased. By the Sayyid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287"></a>[Pg 287]</span>
Ahmad, thou art as my mother. May God cut
short my life if I desert thee in thy present state.”</p>

<p>The lad’s support was of some comfort to her.</p>

<p>In the first blue of night, when daylight lingers
in the memory, they were following a sandy road
towards the city, when a noise as of the sea arose
behind them. The donkey-boy was first to hear
it. He stood still and listened, holding up his
hand. It seemed approaching on the road behind
them. He looked puzzled; then suddenly let
fall his hands, and made a bound.</p>

<p>“It is the army! Come, O my lady! We
must hide ourselves. Hold fast!” He made
the donkey gallop for a hundred yards, then led it
down into a patch of cane. Peeping out between
the stems they saw vague forms in clouds of dust
approaching on the dyke above. The roar became
the jangle of accoutrements, the roll of heavy
carriages upon the road and murmuring voices.</p>

<p>Innumerable ranks of horsemen passed, dust-stained
and weary, with faces resolutely strained
towards Cairo. Barakah saw them as the figures
of a dream. Their silhouette against the sky
appeared familiar. The words with which they
cheered their tired horses rang on memory.</p>

<p>“It is the English,” whispered her companion
hoarsely.</p>

<p>“The English! Allah, help me!” murmured
Barakah. Until that moment she had lost remembrance
of the war.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXV" id="CHAPTER_XXXV"></a>CHAPTER XXXV</h2>


<p>The streets by night were full of people, in striking
contrast with their emptiness at noon that day.
The mosques were all alight inside, and from
the glimpse which Barakah obtained through
open doorways appeared crowded.</p>

<p>She saw men making towards them through
the press, embracing precious bundles, with the
look of fugitives.</p>

<p>“Their fear is of the English,” said the donkey-boy.
“Who knows what they will do by way of
punishment?”</p>

<p>But the look on all the faces when a ray of light
revealed them, the note of the vast murmur lapping
the whole city, was rather of relief and comfort
than anxiety. To hide away their treasures was a
mere precaution which only madmen would neglect
in presence of a conquering host; but men were
thankful for the coming of the English, which
meant an end to anarchy and wild suspense.</p>

<p>“Wallahi, they are warriors,” one orator was
declaiming at a street corner. “The fight was
far away at daybreak, and now behold them
here among us in the citadel. Wallahi, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289"></a>[Pg 289]</span>
are mighty! They smite hard&mdash;one blow and all
is said. Wallahi, they are not of those who loiter.
They appeared among us like a vision of the rising
night; they demanded the keys of our strong
places as of right divine. The people in the
street stood still and gaped on them, rubbing their
eyes to ascertain that they were not asleep. May
Allah make them merciful. The praise to Allah!”</p>

<p>The donkey-boy, who had been looking at the
lady’s eyes at frequent intervals as if in expectation
of a change of purpose, asked at length:</p>

<p>“Whither shall I conduct thee, O my mistress?
Is it not thy wish to return to the house?”</p>

<p>“I have no house,” was her reply. “Did I not
tell thee? To the El Afîfi cemetery!”</p>

<p>“Not by night! Hear reason, O my lady!”
he besought her. “Tell me where thou dwellest,
that I may conduct thee thither!”</p>

<p>“I go to the cemetery, as I told thee. It is
necessary. If thou art weary of my service, I will
pay thee and go out alone.”</p>

<p>Barakah’s tone grew plaintive, almost tearful.
The resolution in her words was mere bravado.
She knew that she was utterly dependent on this
friendly youth, whose company alone kept up her
courage. From the moment of her turning back
she had felt stupid, useless, relying on this boy to
bring her to the cemetery, where she hoped to die.
It seemed a certainty that if she prayed her utmost,
full as her heart was, the vexed soul must leave the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290"></a>[Pg 290]</span>
body, and the prayer by sheer brute force become
acceptable. At thought of being baulked of her
self-sacrifice, the boy’s help failing, she began to
whimper.</p>

<p>“Nay, dearest lady, weep not!” he entreated.
“By Allah, thou shalt neither walk nor go alone.
I will conduct thee thither; but it may be necessary
that we wait till morning, since the way is lonely
and the haunt of ginn. See here, before us is my
mother’s house. Deign to go in and rest awhile,
and take refreshment, while I feed the donkey.
I will make inquiries. If it is possible to go to-night,
I swear to take thee. If not, thou canst
rest here until the dawn.”</p>

<p>They had stopped before a doorway in a narrow
alley. He went a little way into the gloom and
whispered:</p>

<p>“O my mother!”</p>

<p>“Is it thou, Selîm?” came back the answer.</p>

<p>“O my mother, come at once! I have a lady,
a great lady in disguise. She has run mad through
grief in these bad times, and wants to go out to the
cemetery. Receive her in thy house a minute,
feed her, talk to calm her; while I discover if the
way is safe.”</p>

<p>“The cemetery! Go not thither. Best come
in and sleep.”</p>

<p>“The lady is distraught with grief. I reverence
her like a parent. She is absent from the world;
she does not hear us. I think that she is going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291"></a>[Pg 291]</span>
to the tombs to pray. It were a good deed to
conduct her thither.”</p>

<p>“True, wallahi! May Allah heal her soul, the
poor one! These be dreadful times!”</p>

<p>A woman came out to the doorway, holding up
an earthen lamp.</p>

<p>“Deign to enter, O my sweet,” she called
seductively.</p>

<p>Selîm assisted his employer to dismount.</p>

<p>“Go in and rest,” he whispered. “My mother
and my sister are alone in there. Thou canst
unveil. The dwellings of the poor are all haramlik.
In a little while I shall return and call thee from
without. I go but to make sure the ways are safe.”</p>

<p>The room in which she found herself was small
and stuffy. It was lighted only by the little
lamp the woman carried. Barakah was glad to
loose her veil awhile. She refused the food, but
drank the water, which the women offered, and
listened to their cordial blessings with a sense of
dreaming. Her prayer was that the boy might
not decide to wait till morning. Desire to reach
the tomb at once absorbed her life. Deprived of
it, she would have had no further being. Her
prayer now took the Christian form, and now the
Muslim; the two religions growing tangled in her
tired mind. At length the boy’s voice sounded:</p>

<p>“Deign to come, O lady. The ways are thronged,
they tell me, as in Ragab. To-night is not as
other nights, it is well seen.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292"></a>[Pg 292]</span></p>

<p>With praise to Allah she went out once more.
But with its object now assured, her mind grew
dull. It was as if suspense alone had held it wakeful.
It lost the comprehension of its purpose,
regained it with an effort, and then let it go.</p>

<p>They passed beneath an ancient gateway. The
city was behind them. Still there was no solitude.
Groups of people crossed the sand in all directions.
It was a moonless night. The many lanterns
moving in the darkness seemed reflections of the
stars which shone like gems of many facets in the
silky sky. Barakah saw them both alike as golden
insects swarming in the cup of a great purple
flower. At moments, her head swimming, she
mistook the earth for sky, and had the sense of
moving upside down.</p>

<p>“There is the cemetery,” said her guide. His
whisper seemed to her a long way off. Nor did
she see the city of the dead till they were in its
streets, which loomed mysterious. The very stars
looked sinister above the frowning domes, from
which a blacker darkness seemed to emanate.
The many crescents looked like horns against the
sky. Bats flitted past her; from the distance came
a jackal’s howl. What had she come to do there?
She could not remember. “To pray,” she told
herself, but that meant nothing. She strove
with all her might to recollect. Then in a flash
remembrance came to her; it bore her on, excited,
to the mausoleum. She dismounted, and then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293"></a>[Pg 293]</span>
upon the threshold, she forgot once more. She
entered, shuddering, too dazed to question why
the gate was left ajar, and turned instinctively
towards the women’s quarters. A step or two and
she stood still in deadly terror, hardly venturing
to breathe. There was a light upon the men’s
side; beasts were tethered in the court; she
heard a sound of digging and men’s voices. Her
thought was, “They expect me, and have dug a
grave.” As soon as fear would let her, she fled
back to where the guide was waiting.</p>

<p>“There are people. We must fly! Make haste!”
she whispered.</p>

<p>He helped her to remount, and they retraced their
steps. The solemn thoughts which had possessed
her mind gave place to rattle of dry bones and
impish laughter. A merry dance was going on
within her brain, as mad as could be, though her
senses were quite clear&mdash;clearer than ever they
had been before, she knew exultantly. She rode
out from the place of tombs across the sandhills
towards the city.</p>

<p>“Hist!” said her companion suddenly, and
stopped the donkey, hanging on to its tail to
prevent braying. “There are men without a
lantern&mdash;robbers! I hear voices.”</p>

<p>She strained her ears in the direction pointed.</p>

<p>“Am I not acknowledged sheykh of all the
thieves?” some unseen man amid the darkness was
exclaiming angrily. “Was it not I alone who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294"></a>[Pg 294]</span>
had the wisdom to foresee that every man would
seek to hide his wealth this night? It is light
work for you; they fly like conies at a shout,
leaving their treasure, and the light for you to
count it. Why then grumble that I sit here and
receive the gold? Some one must hold it for
fair distribution. Say, have I ever wronged a man
among you of one small piaster? See, yonder
comes another lantern. Go, do your work, and
say no more to me.”</p>

<p>“Stay, O my lady! For the love of Allah,”
moaned Selîm. “They are robbers, murderers,
the worst of ruffians.”</p>

<p>But Barakah had urged the donkey forward;
the laughter in her brain deriding fear. She
headed straight towards the voices, waving her
left arm and shouting madly. She heard a shriek
of “The afrîtah! Help, O Allah!” and saw
men running as if fiends pursued them. Her
next sensation was a dive into the sand. The
ass had stumbled. Selîm assisted her to rise, and
murmured reassuring words which made her cry.</p>

<p>Remembrance of her little daughter overcame
her. She had prayed to Christ to guard her
child before she recollected that the prayer was
useless. There was no mercy for disciples of
the Arab prophet. She reeled and would have
fallen had not Selîm caught her. As it was, she
sank upon the ground, refusing to remount or
take another step.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295"></a>[Pg 295]</span></p>

<p>The boy, resigned, sat down beside her, holding
his donkey by the halter-rope. They were upon
the trodden plain below the citadel. Lying upon
her back, she saw a blackness rising till it took
the shape of bastions, walls, towers, surmounted
by a dome and needle-pointed minarets. Gazing
at this and at the stars she fell asleep.</p>

<p>When she awoke it was still night. The
donkey-boy was snoring on the ground hard by.
A chill and a strange silence hung about her.
The stars above were throbbing violently as if
about to burst in showers of light. Her grief
returned upon her like an ague. “O Lord, have
mercy on me!” she exclaimed, and groaned
aloud.</p>

<p>“What ails thee, O my sister?” said a voice
so sweet, so unexpected in its nearness, that it
stopped her heart.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXXVI</h2>


<p>From the shadow of a mass of houses close at
hand emerged the figure of a man in flowing
robes, and glided towards her. For the moment
she supposed it was an angel. Again the sweet
voice thrilled her, asking:</p>

<p>“What ails thee, O my sister? Art thou
wounded? May Allah heal and comfort thee
in thy distress!”</p>

<p>She knew him then and felt a sudden craving.</p>

<p>“O Tâhir, sing to me!” she moaned. “Thy
voice is healing. Canst thou still sing when thy
delight is dead?”</p>

<p>“Who art thou, lady?” He peered hard at her.</p>

<p>“I am the English wife of Yûsuf Pasha.”</p>

<p>“True; it is true,” he murmured, recollecting.
“I heard that she had fled the house distraught
with grief.... Hearken, O my lady, I am
waiting here for the muezzin of the Sultan Hasan
mosque, to ask his leave to call the Dawn instead
of him. Victorious infidels are on the height
above us; and no man can predict the future
of this land. It is a black day for the Faith,
may Allah help us! Our souls are humbled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297"></a>[Pg 297]</span>
weeping tears of blood. I lay upon my bed, but
could not sleep for thinking on this grief. My
heart and brain were full of singing, sad and
noble. I felt the need to sing to God alone.
And I vowed within my soul that none but Tâhir
should call to prayer this dawn at yonder mosque
within the shadow of the citadel which holds
our shame. Now till my vow is paid I cannot
guide thee. I beg thee enter the muezzin’s house
and rest till my return.... Ah, here he comes.”</p>

<p>The thud as of a wooden bolt withdrawn, the
creak of a door opening reached their ears. The
singer ran in the direction of the sound. She heard
him coaxing the muezzin, who replied upon a yawn:</p>

<p>“With honour and with reverence, O Tâhir!
It is thine to order.”</p>

<p>They had both drawn near to Barakah, entreating
her to go indoors and rest, when the
donkey-boy, aroused at last, rushed on them
with stick raised.</p>

<p>“Where is my lady?” he cried out dementedly.
“For the love of Allah, harm her not; her mind is
troubled!”</p>

<p>They had some ado to reassure the lad, who
was but half awake. Tâhir renewed his prayer
to Barakah to enter the muezzin’s house without
delay. She cried to be allowed to wait and hear
his singing.</p>

<p>“Well, stay with her, O Mustafa! Bring
cushions out! And thou, O best of donkey-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298"></a>[Pg 298]</span>drivers,
seek the house of Yûsuf Pasha, inquire
for one Ghandûr, and bring him hither!”</p>

<p>The boy bestrode his ass and disappeared into
the darkness; the singer strode off, eager to
perform his vow. The muezzin fetched some
cushions from his house, and led the lady through
the gloom until the minaret of Sultan Hasan
loomed before them, and Barakah could distinguish
its projecting gallery. Then he spread
the cushions as a couch, himself subsiding on
the ground behind her.</p>

<p>Barakah waited for what seemed long hours,
so great was her impatience, like the sharpest
hunger. Then, suddenly, when she had almost
ceased to hope, a high, sweet note, sustained
most wonderfully, filled her ear. It caused a
parting of the lips, a melting rapture. It broke
in a cascade of melody. Then came the long
sweet note again, not held this time, but uttered
often with a sobbed insistence. And then the song
soared up to heights of praise, or hovered over
depths of sorrow; she was lost in it. Uprising
from the fount of hope in sadness, it soared to
certainty of endless joy. The sound was no
made music, but a soul poured forth in glorious
melody, as spontaneous and unerring as the song
of birds. The greatest singer in the world stood
there unseen in the suspended gallery, and sang
his heart out to the praise of the Creator, watching
the dawn’s first gleam above the eastern hill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299"></a>[Pg 299]</span></p>

<p>On Barakah the song fell like a voice from
heaven. She beheld great light. Her grief,
her terrors, became natural shadows. There was
one God for Christian and for Muslim. Beyond
the striving and the hatred waited peace and love.</p>

<p>The professional muezzin on the ground behind
her was rocking with enjoyment, gasping, sobbing:
“Enough, O Tâhir! Of thy kindness, stop!
Wouldst kill me quite? I faint, expire! It is
too much of rapture! See me die! Praise be to
Allah for the faith of El Islâm. Praise to the
benign Creator who has vouchsafed a voice to
creatures for His glory!”</p>

<p>Another whispered: “That is no man’s song,
but the song of Israfîl. Surely the last day is
dawning. Praise to Allah!” And yet another
murmured: “Praise to Him who sleepeth not
nor dieth, the Merciful, the Compassionate, the
Light of Lights, the Living King!”</p>

<p>Selîm the donkey-boy had come up with
Ghandûr. They spoke no word to Barakah
until the last note died. By then the pallor of
the dawn shone on them faintly, showing the look
of sadness which succeeds enchantment. Ghandûr
then came and kissed the hand of Barakah,
begging her of her kindness to return with him.</p>

<p>He and Selîm together lifted her on to the donkey.</p>

<p>As they left the square the English bugles
sounded on the height above.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXXVII"></a>CHAPTER XXXVII</h2>


<p>Quickly the daylight spread and filled the
streets; while overhead successive darts of light
pierced the incumbent darkness and dispelled
it, till the sun’s first ray reddened the minarets
and plunged the streets in azure shade. Men
came out from their doorways as from tombs,
and went about their business listlessly. Among
the lower classes it was quite expected that the
English would take vengeance on the town that
day. The people did not care; they were in
Allah’s hands, and gave Him thanks because the
war was ended.</p>

<p>For Barakah the city wore its usual air; the
only wretched figure was her own. She was
being led back to a life which had become intolerable.
After her tragic flight of yesterday,
how ignominious was this meek return! Ghandûr,
beside her, talked of the extreme anxiety in
which her flight had plunged the Pasha’s family.</p>

<p>“O my lady, how hadst thou the heart to
cause us such despair? Think of it! One
like thee, alone and in the streets at such a time,
when all authority is in abeyance, and the English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301"></a>[Pg 301]</span>
host may come at any moment with the lust
of conquerors! A hundred men were searching
for thee through the night. My lord the Pasha
thought that grief might lead thee to the place
of tombs, and he himself went thither with the
slaves enjoined to hide our valuables. Praise
be to Allah, thou art found at last! Take
comfort, O my lady! Often and often have I
grieved for thee, alone among us! And when
our great calamity befell&mdash;alas, that son of mine
should bear such evil tidings!&mdash;I prayed to Allah
to reveal to thee His boundless mercy. For it
has no limits. For all who suffer in this world
He will redress the balance. Even the unhorned
cattle, O my lady! It is written.”</p>

<p>Barakah heard these consolations as a dreary
murmur.</p>

<p>“I am taking thee to the late Pasha’s house,
to the great lady,” he informed her. “My lord
considers it will be less sad for thee.”</p>

<p>The great lady meant no other than Murjânah
Khânum. Recalling the authority Murjânah
wielded, Barakah imagined she was being led to
punishment.</p>

<p>Two eunuchs came forth, bowing, crying,
“Praise to Allah!” They helped her to dismount,
and both supported her. A minute later
she had passed the harîm screen. Her brief
excursion in the world was ended. She was once
more caged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302"></a>[Pg 302]</span></p>

<p>Imagining her crime to be as great as that of
Christian nun in breaking convent, and knowing
that Murjânah Khânum could be ruthless, she
expected torture; instead of which she was
caressed and put to bed.</p>

<p>She had her lodging in Murjânah’s rooms, was
dosed by Fitnah, comforted by Leylah Khânum.
The younger ladies came as visitors and talked
to cheer her. Old Umm ed-Dahak, not to be
excluded, crouched by her bed and crooned as
to an infant.</p>

<p>“Why are you all so kind to me?” she asked
one day. “I tried to flee, I tell you, to escape
to Europe&mdash;yet you pet me!”</p>

<p>“All things are pardoned to great grief,”
replied Murjânah. “It was not thy fault, O
poor one! Would to Allah I could show thee
what I see more clearly than I see thee in this
room&mdash;the power of God, His mercy all around
us. Fain would I hear thee give Him praise for
thy misfortune. He sees and knows; we fancy;
it is weak to strive. Think, O my fawn, my
lily, thou hast still one child; thou hadst thy boy
for thy delight for fifteen years. More fortunate
than I who lost all mine in infancy! What peace
can come to woman in thy case who does not
offer up her will to God? The men have promise
of a certain paradise; we have no certitude
of what awaits us. Yet are we not dejected,
for we know God’s mercy, and leave the future<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303"></a>[Pg 303]</span>
gladly in His hands. We women are not bargainers,
we serve for love; and the mercy of the Highest
cannot fail. Thou hast been brought up otherwise
to prouder thoughts. Humble thy soul if thou
wouldst find relief.”</p>

<p>“I proud?” cried Barakah. “Thou, the
proudest woman I have ever known, canst call me
so? I am not as thou art&mdash;strong and dauntless,
cruel in thy resignation. I am feeble and afraid.”</p>

<p>“May Allah strengthen thee and drive out
fear!”</p>

<p>Barakah had lost the vision which had come
from Tâhir’s singing&mdash;a vision which ignored
divergences of race and custom. Without her
son the harîm life was senseless; she held the
Muslim faith in secret dread; and longed for
sentimental Christian people. Yûsuf, her husband,
proved the soul of kindness, yet she had almost
hated him in her revolt from all his race.</p>

<p>One day he told the ladies in her presence:</p>

<p>“The English are not bad. They take wise
measures for the land’s redemption. They have
asked me to take office, and I have a mind to
do so.”</p>

<p>It was the first time she had heard the English
mentioned since her reimprisonment. In fact,
the Turkish pride had suffered cruelly from this
intrusion of a European power, the more so that
the natives of the land acclaimed it. Though the
English arms restored their party in the State,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304"></a>[Pg 304]</span>
the Turks in Egypt gnawed their lips and could
not speak of them.</p>

<p>A new way of escape appeared to Barakah. She
could obtain an audience of the English rulers and
announce her longing to return to Christianity.
She pined for the ideals of Christian lands, the
independent life of women, and their varied
interests. Here she had lost her value, having
lost her son. She would soon be an old woman, a
mere worn-out animal.</p>

<p>Directly she conceived this plan, she grew more
cheerful, and even felt some kindness for the
harîm walls. While making her endeavour to
find out from Yûsuf the names of Englishmen
of influence, their character and reputation, she
wanted to make certain he would be consoled.</p>

<p>“Light of my eyes,” she whispered, nestling to
him, “I have quite outgrown my foolish prejudice.
I beg thee now to wed another wife. The son I
bore to thee is dead, and I grow old.”</p>

<p>“Wallahi, thou art still delicious,” he replied
gallantly; but all the same he thanked her, seeming
much relieved.</p>

<p>Perceiving that the anguish of her grief was
past, the ladies let her go to her own house.</p>

<p>“Remember my advice,” said old Murjânah in
farewell. “Behold, my eyes grow dim, my days are
numbered. I speak not frivolously like the young.
Give up thy will. That is to islam truly. May
Allah grant thee resignation, which is strength.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXVIII"></a>CHAPTER XXXVIII</h2>


<p>She had not been in her own house a day, before
she said to Umm ed-Dahak:</p>

<p>“Wilt thou do me a great service?”</p>

<p>“Wallahi, that will I! Even&mdash;saving thy
presence&mdash;one most sinful!”</p>

<p>“And canst thou keep a secret from the seed of
Adam?”</p>

<p>“Not only that, but from the walls and air.”</p>

<p>“I want a letter carried to a great one of the
English.”</p>

<p>“I seek refuge in Allah!” gasped the old
woman, grinning widely. “Knowest thou it is
a crime unheard of that thou askest of me? Fie
upon thee! Wallahi, if I did my duty I should
leave thee straightway!”</p>

<p>But far from flying from her mistress she came
nearer. Her wrinkles ran to smiles; her old eyes
twinkled.</p>

<p>“Come, let us reason!” she remarked, as she
sat down, and, fingering her lady’s hand, began
the argument.</p>

<p>“If thou desirest recreation of a shameful kind,
let me discover some devout believer. Thus the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306"></a>[Pg 306]</span>
sin is less. Or better still, approach thy husband,
tell him thou art weary, implore him of his mercy
to release thee, with a portion of thy dowry. No
man would refuse the offer after years of marriage.
Then I could find thee a good Muslim, for diversion.
But a Frank&mdash;an unbeliever! Ask me not! It
is too horrible!”</p>

<p>“By Allah, my desire is not the thing thou
thinkest!” Barakah made answer gaily. “This
Englishman is one I knew in childhood. I would
speak with him. The matter is no other than my
lord’s advancement, though if he knew I meddled
he would kill me!”</p>

<p>“Swear to that! But swear to that!” cried
Umm ed-Dahak, much excited, “and I can do
thy errand without sin. But if thy mind is for a
Frank, I could unearth thee Muslims of that race;
though most of them are idiotic from hashîsh.”</p>

<p>“My errand is to this one only!”</p>

<p>“Good, I go.”</p>

<p>The lady clapped her hands and called for
writing things. The letter taxed her mind for
hours; the fitting phrase, the correct tone, eluding
one who for so many years had penned no word of
English. At last it was completed. She implored
the great official, of his mercy, his great kindness,
to receive an English lady, long immured in the
harîm, where she had suffered greatly. She wished
to make a most important statement (this she
underlined) and begged him to secure the utmost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307"></a>[Pg 307]</span>
secrecy. She would not write her name for fear
the letter should be intercepted, but would reveal
it to him with the other matter when they met.
The document, enveloped and sealed down, was
put into the hands of Umm ed-Dahak. After
two hours, she brought back the answer, “Tomorrow
at the fourth hour,” given her by word of
mouth. She had not seen the Englishman himself.</p>

<p>“Wallahi, we will make thee beautiful,” she
chuckled.</p>

<p>Then Barakah reviewed her prison with affection.
She went from room to room, observing for remembrance.
In one, the slave-girls crouched round
an old hag who told a story. The light which fell
like powder from the lattice singled out their teeth
and eyeballs, and woke a blue sheen in the copper
vessels round the wall. In another, the child
Afîfah stood up on the seat beside the lattice, feeding
pigeons; the wife of Ghandûr, standing by, supported
her. A little wicket in the tracery was open.</p>

<p>“H’m-h’m-h’m-h’m!” Afîfah gave the pigeon-call,
and held out crumbs. A fluttering cloud of
white and iridescent down, pink, shell-like claws,
and avid beaks and eyes, beset the lattice from without,
its shadow watering the child’s delighted face.</p>

<p>Barakah retired without disturbing them. She
had a hankering to take the little girl with her.
But no, Afîfah was a child of El Islâm. Like all
the rest, she would condemn and curse her mother.</p>

<p>Then visitors arrived&mdash;Gulbeyzah and Bedr-ul-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308"></a>[Pg 308]</span>Budûr&mdash;and
Barakah waxed sentimental in her
talk with them, recalling all the pleasant hours
which they had spent together. Both were now
grown obese and double-chinned. Nothing remained
of the resplendent beauty which had
marked their girlhood save the eyes, which made
them still attractive when they wore the face-veil.
She pitied them, with anguish for herself; and
kissed them fondly when they rose to go.</p>

<p>Then Yûsuf came to spend an hour with her.
She thanked him with sincere emotion for his never-failing
kindness to her during all those years.</p>

<p>“It is nothing but thy due,” he answered, greatly
touched. “Thou art alone among us, and my
cherished wife.”</p>

<p>That night the very howling of the street-dogs
sounded sweet; the starlight at her lattice seemed
a humble friend. Her heart bled for the parting
which was very near. For not a doubt existed
in her mind but that the English, once informed of
her desire for Christianity, would snatch her from
the Muslims with a mighty hand. The power was
theirs; they governed Egypt; and she knew from
her remembrance that they were fanatical. They
would welcome her conversion, and defend her.</p>

<p>In the morning Umm ed-Dahak bubbled over
with excitement. She accompanied her lady to
the bath, and bade the bath attendant take all
measures to enhance her beauty. She assured
her mistress in an eager whisper:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309"></a>[Pg 309]</span></p>

<p>“Trust Umm ed-Dahak, I have managed everything.”</p>

<p>She had given orders in her lady’s name that
the harîm carriage and a eunuch should be ready
at a certain hour. She and Barakah were driven
to a shop of good repute, famed for its stock of
Frankish boots and gloves, of which the harîm
ladies were enamoured as showing off their pretty
hands and feet.</p>

<p>“Our business here may take some time&mdash;an
hour, perhaps,” she told the eunuch, who took
position sentry-wise beside the entrance. The
shop possessed two doors. Making a trifling
purchase, they went out unnoticed, and found
themselves within a stone’s throw of the public
office which the English ruler had appointed for
the interview.</p>

<p>The street in blazing sunlight was flowing with a
many-coloured crowd, which kept up such a jabber
that Barakah could not think clearly. The scene
she had rehearsed appeared ridiculous. Seized
with panic, she was anxious to turn back; but
Umm ed-Dahak at her elbow whispered courage.
In a minute she had entered a great doorway
leading to a wide stone hall, where soldiers lounged.
One of them came forward at a beck from Umm
ed-Dahak. Then the old woman went and squatted
on the doorstep, and Barakah, half dead with
terror, was led on alone.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXXIX"></a>CHAPTER XXXIX</h2>


<p>“You asked for a private interview. It is a little
unusual, I believe, in this country; but I granted
your request upon the understanding that you
have important secrets to communicate, as stated
in your letter. Let me see&mdash;ah, here it is!”</p>

<p>The English official&mdash;a broad-shouldered, fresh-complexioned
man inclined to baldness&mdash;having
studied her appearance through a monocle, let fall
that weapon and, disturbing papers on his desk,
produced the letter she had written to him, which
looked somehow pitiful.</p>

<p>“I am an English lady. My name is Mary
Smith. I did a very wicked thing. I turned
Mahometan, and married a Turkish gentleman, a
Pasha, here in Cairo. I want to leave him and
return to Christianity. I am an English lady,
by name Mary Smith; not what they call me.
I am prepared to take my oath that this is true,
and Mrs. Cameron can tell you&mdash;I must get away!”</p>

<p>“What is all this, and who is Mrs. Cameron?
In what way does your private history concern me?
I beg you to pass on to the important statement
which you have to make.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311"></a>[Pg 311]</span></p>

<p>“I ask your help to get away from the harîm.”</p>

<p>At that the Englishman resumed his eyeglass and
surveyed her with a slight gape of amazement.</p>

<p>The scene of conversation was a large room,
sparsely furnished with a desk, a table and a few
plain chairs. The light from the high window shone
on Barakah who, to prove that she was really English,
had removed her face-veil. The critic’s wondering
stare first made her conscious of the discrepancy with
her request of highly raddled cheeks and lips, and
kohled eyes&mdash;the touches Umm ed-Dahak had declared
so beautiful. She was not a European any
longer. Her very words resounded with a foreign
accent. From the moment of her entering the
presence of this hateful man, she had been persuaded
of the folly of her errand, out of heart with
it. Her speech, when uttered, carried no conviction.</p>

<p>“Indeed, indeed, I am an Englishwoman,” she
persisted, with a kind of whimper. “I want to get
away from here and lead a Christian life.”</p>

<p>But while she spoke the words her hands were
busy readjusting the white muslin mouth-veil as a
step towards going.</p>

<p>The great official shrugged his shoulders “Is
that all you have to say?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps&mdash;I mean, I know that I did wrong
to come here.” She was quivering from head to
foot with shame. The act of sitting on a chair
embarrassed her. She was completely out of
touch with English ways.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312"></a>[Pg 312]</span></p>

<p>“Well, I don’t quite see what I can do for you,”
said her appraiser, in a tone of bland reproach.
“You see we are here as guardians of the laws and
customs of the country. We could hardly, therefore,
interfere in a case such as yours&mdash;a harîm quarrel.
As for the religious controversy, I can tell you we
avoid it like hot coals. Our one desire is to uphold
the institutions of the country. Really, my dear
lady, I think the only thing for you to do is to go
straight home and make the best of it.”</p>

<p>At that she rose. He passed before her to the
door and held it open. She thought of offering her
hand, but his grand bow forbade it; and she went
out in profound humiliation.</p>

<p>“Well, art thou happy?” chuckled Umm ed-Dahak,
still believing that she was the servant of a
criminal intrigue. She prattled merrily till they
regained the carriage and were driving homeward,
when she noticed that her lady trembled and
looked sad.</p>

<p>“Alas!” she cried. “My dove, my poor one,
is it so? Woe, woe for womankind! There
comes a time to all of us when love escapes.”</p>

<p>But Barakah surveyed a wider disillusion.</p>

<p>Until just now she had been strong in the conceit
that she was different from Eastern women,
recognizably of higher race. From her dreams
with Umm ed-Dahak, built on memories of Mrs.
Cameron’s entreaties and the Consul’s arguments,
she had derived the notion that she was of value<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313"></a>[Pg 313]</span>
to the English, who would fain reclaim her. Now
that mirage, born of the sleepy harîm atmosphere,
was swept away; and she was nothing. With
English people, she would always long for Orientals;
with Orientals, feel a yearning for the life of Europe.</p>

<p>And in religion, likewise, she was nothing. A
Christian by conviction after years of scoffing, she
was doomed to play the part of a Mahometan,
to lose her soul. And she was glad to be returning
to the life so lately dreaded, the vision of herself in
English eyes had so appalled her. Well, she was
nothing, and her soul of small account. The
harîm was her natural home; the teaching of the
wise and kindly Prophet her protection. She
now beheld the vanity of all her struggles, the
vulgarity of much concern about the future. God
was merciful! In self-annihilation there was peace.
Thus through her striving after Christianity she
reached at last the living heart of El Islâm.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XL" id="CHAPTER_XL"></a>CHAPTER XL</h2>


<p>It was strange how, with her broken spirit, she regained
a kindly interest in all around her. She had
found the keynote of harîm existence&mdash;resignation;
not merely passive, but exultant as an act
of worship. The gross, full-blooded speech, the
something cruel in these women, which in the day
of sentimental pride had seemed intolerable, was
but the natural outcome of relentless vision. In
the first fervour of her self-abasement she stood
beside the deathbed of Murjânah Khânum,
watched her last struggle, and endured the death-room
orgies without flinching. Thenceforth she
took up the old Muslim standpoint, denouncing all
the fallacies of Europe. Having won from Yûsuf
the confession that he kept three other women,
she had them brought to the old Pasha’s palace,
where she lived thenceforward, to rid his dealings
of the surreptitiousness which smacks of vice.
She received them sometimes in her rooms, and
took benignant notice of their children, but remained
aloof. They called her “the great lady,”
and deferred to her.</p>

<p>When the festivals of visitation of the dead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315"></a>[Pg 315]</span>
came round, she would withdraw into the tomb for
days together, but showed no mournfulness at
other seasons. When Englishwomen called on
her (as sometimes happened, for Yûsuf held a high
position in the Government), she spoke in stilted
French, and never hinted that she knew their
language, or was other than the thing she seemed&mdash;a
Turkish lady. She felt assured that, had she
carried out her plan and fled to Europe after her
son’s death, she would have gone mad in that
sentimental atmosphere with all her memories.
More than the English, she disliked some French
and German ladies who, without renouncing their
religion or their nationality, had married Muslims.
These, in their visits, showed a curiosity, and
used a tone of patronage, which was offensive.
Of races less exclusive than the English, they kept
their European friends, maintained their liberty.
They had no real conception of the harîm life.</p>

<p>She was angry with her daughter when the
latter told her:</p>

<p>“At marriage I shall make my husband promise
to have me alone before I yield to him. It is become
the fashion in the noblest houses. Of course,
if I should fail to bear a son, I should release
him.”</p>

<p>“Endeavour to retain him by thy charms,” the
mother scolded. “O foolish one, to make him
promise is to make him sin. In following the
madness of the Frankish women, thou dost but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316"></a>[Pg 316]</span>
court deception in the Frankish manner. It all
comes of the reading of French stories without
knowledge or intelligence.”</p>

<p>It vexed her soul to see young girls forsaking the
old stately way to hanker for the trash of Europe,
which they misconceived. Afîfah had no notion
of that mutual love and comradeship which is the
sole excuse for monogamic marriage; she merely
thought it fine to be an only wife. When harîm
ladies talked of feminine emancipation, they
understood it to involve licentiousness. Their
genius was at once too indolent and too direct
ever to harbour European vapours.</p>

<p>But these vagaries were restricted to a score
of wealthy houses, and even there the harîm life
went on the same. There were the lattices, the
veils, the eunuchs, and some few slaves in spite
of many edicts; the ladies still had their old
interests and rules and customs; the same old
women hawked the news and bawdy tales from
house to house; and superstition flourished more
than ever. Young wives who had been bred
up in the Frankish culture, and insisted on the
husband talking French in private, consulted
witches when the baby ailed, or sent a portion of his
clothing to be blood-stained at a zâr.</p>

<p>Afîfah married in due course a high official, and
Barakah spent half the year with her. The mother
had her little circle of old friends, and many protégés&mdash;in
particular the house of Ghandûr, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317"></a>[Pg 317]</span>
first-born, Ali, she regarded always as her son.
Her age seemed not unhappy.</p>

<p>On a summer evening, she was sitting on the
roof of the old Pasha’s palace, watching the sunset
with Gulbeyzah, Na´imah, and two of Yûsuf’s
sisters who had come to visit her. Red light as
of a conflagration shone around them. The shadow
cast towards them by the parapet was vastly
elongated and as black as ink. A tray with fruit
and sherbet rested on the ground, and a slave-girl,
squatting on her heels before them, awaiting
their good pleasure to remove it, followed their
conversation with an eager smile.</p>

<p>The English had been five-and-twenty years in
Cairo, and mighty changes had distressed the
world of men, but the harîm seemed changeless
in its calm seclusion. Beliefs as old as Egypt
lingered there, and new things introduced were
made to serve old customs. Yet the ladies had
been sighing at the growth of innovations.</p>

<p>“Dost thou remember, O my sweet one, the little
window in the servants’ passage where I used to
sit and dream as a young maiden?” sighed
Gulbeyzah. “Is it still there? I must go down
and see it! And the little lover on the roof who
waved his arms so wildly? I wonder did he die
of me, the poor young man! Thou didst blame
me for that small amusement; but, by Allah, girls
in these days are less innocent. My granddaughters
read French books till their brains are addled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318"></a>[Pg 318]</span>
They had better sit alone and dream as I
did.”</p>

<p>“The best of life is thinking with hands idle,”
answered Na’imah. “All women do it, and so form
their minds. But the girls to-day have no resources.
They despise embroidery. They needs
must be amused by some strange sight, excited
by unhealthy reading, or they die of ennui.”</p>

<p>“Look, look!” exclaimed Gulbeyzah suddenly.</p>

<p>They all stared in the direction which her finger
pointed.</p>

<p>The slave, who had been waiting their good
pleasure to remove the tray, had started up and
stood against the parapet, looking out towards the
sunset, with her back towards them. Both her
arms were raised as for an incantation. The rosy
light enveloped her as with a halo. Her shadow,
grown enormous, covered half the roof.</p>

<p>“I seek refuge in Allah. Is she worshipping
the sun?” gasped Na’imah. “She should be
punished for such gross impiety.”</p>

<p>“She is going to give that crow his salutation,”
said Gulbeyzah.</p>

<p>The bird had wheeled away, but now drew near
again.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<div class="verse">If bad, draw up thy claws and hie away!”<!--verse--></div>
<!--poetry-container--></div><!--poem--></div><!--stanza--></div>

<p>The slave-girl having chanted the time-honoured
formula, turned to resume her attitude of patient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319"></a>[Pg 319]</span>
waiting. She grinned to find herself the object of
all eyes.</p>

<p>“I shamed him,” she remarked, with a wide
flash of teeth, as she sat down once more.</p>

<p>“Thou knowest the history&mdash;not so, O my
flower?” said Na’imah.</p>

<p>“Umm ed-Dahak has related it a thousand
times&mdash;the Lord have mercy on her!” Barakah
made answer in a tone of fond remembrance.</p>

<p>“O light of my eyes, surely every woman here
in Egypt knows it!” giggled Yûsuf’s youngest
sister. “They say it has been handed down
among us from the days of our lord Noah, when we
sent up the petition.”</p>

<p>“That every girl might be allowed four
husbands?” asked Gulbeyzah.</p>

<p>“More! more!&mdash;or so old Umm ed-Dahak used
to tell me&mdash;as many as she could endure, my
sweet!” laughed Barakah.</p>

<p>“May Allah destroy the house of that most
wicked crow, who has kept us waiting all these thousands
of long years till now!” groaned Na’imah.</p>

<p>“How long! How long, O Lord!” sighed out
Gulbeyzah in a comic ecstasy.</p>

<p>“Never in my time, that is certain, under Allah,”
answered Barakah. “But perhaps you young
ones....”</p>

<p>“Young ones! O Allah, listen to her! Ah,
alas for us!” cried Yûsuf’s youngest sister, with a
sobbing laugh. Whereat the ladies looked into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320"></a>[Pg 320]</span>
each other’s faces, illumined by the greenish light
which follows sunset. A silence and a shudder
fell upon them.</p>

<p>“Allah have mercy on us!” Gulbeyzah broke
the stillness with a shrug. “Behold us finished
for the joys of this low world.”</p>

<p>“The praise to Allah!” answered Na’imah
devoutly.</p>

<p>They were all old withered bodies, for the
grave.</p>

</p>

<p>Lord Rossmore’s recollections should contribute to the
gaiety of the nation, for it would be difficult to find, within
the covers of a book, a collection of stories so racy and
so rich in humour.</p>

<p>Lord Rossmore was a friend of King Edward, and he has
several good stories to tell about the late monarch.</p>

<p>Among the many well-known people who figure prominently
in the book are the Duke and Duchess of Connaught;
the late Duchess of Teck; Consuelo, Duchess of Manchester;
Lord Marcus Beresford; the late Lord Dufferin;
Lord and Lady Zetland; Lord Lonsdale; the late
Viscount Masserene and Ferrard; Lord and Lady
Londonderry; the late Lady Cadogan; Mrs. Cornwallis
West; “Bay” Middleton; “Chicken” Hartopp; and
the late Lord Clonmell.</p>

<p>“Things I Can Tell” abounds in amusing anecdotes,
and there are few people in Society who will not be
tempted to read it&mdash;if only in self-defence&mdash;for, in dining
out this autumn, there is one question which is sure to
be asked, and that is, “Have you read the Rossmore
Recollections?”</p>

LIFE</h3>

<p class="center"><i>By <b>Princess Louise of Prussia</b></i></p>

<p class="center">
Illustrated&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Price 16/- net
</p>

<p>An important and interesting autobiography, containing
many recollections of royal persons. The Princess was a
niece of Frederick the Great and has several anecdotes to
tell of him. Many secrets of his Court, and of the Courts
of his two successors, are for the first time made public in
this fascinating volume. There are also stories of
Napoleon, Talleyrand, Madame de Staël, the Empress
Elizabeth of Russia, and most of the European notabilities
of the period. The author lived in stirring times, amid
wars and rumours of wars, and she gives a lively and
graphic account of them&mdash;also the inner history of the
Peace of Tilsit.</p>


<h3 title="">KING EDWARD IN HIS TRUE

</p>

<p>No matter how great the reputation, there comes a time
when the memory of a magnetic personality becomes a
target for the dispassionate historian, and the Memoir in
the recently published volume of the Dictionary of National
Biography indicates that this time has arrived even with
regard to King Edward. In view of the great prominence
given to this Memoir, no small interest will attach to the
new biography by Mr. Edward Legge&mdash;well-known as a
forcible and candid writer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="A-Page_3" id="A-Page_3"></a>[Pg 3]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Legge, who shows an exceptionally intimate acquaintance
with the personality of King Edward, narrates
the notable events in his career with the utmost frankness.</p>

<p>He shows him as diplomat and statesman, as “The
Friend of Kings” and “At His Best” (to quote from his
chapter headings), and, in a section entitled “A Great
Figure,” treats of him from many points of view, including
the anecdotal and amusing.</p>

<p>On unchallengable evidence, Mr. Legge is able to refute
certain portions of the National Biography Memoir, and
he also deals with the personal relations between King
Edward and the German Emperor; though this, among
other parts of his book, is likely to provoke some controversy.</p>

<p>Mr. Legge concludes a striking and well-balanced volume
with a special section on Queen Alexandra.</p>


<h3 title="">A KEEPER OF ROYAL SECRETS</h3>

<p class="center">Being the Private and Political Life of
Madame de Genlis</p>

<p class="center"><i>By <b>Jean Harmand</b></i></p>

<p class="center">
Illustrated&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Price 16/- net
</p>

<p>The career of Madame de Genlis is one of the baffling
enigmas of history. For the greater part of her life she
played an important role in the social and political life
of France.</p>

<p>By virtue of her intimate association with Philip Egalité,
Duc d’Orleans, and her high position as the Governor
of Louis Phillipe and the other Orleans children, the
influence she wielded practically amounted to royal power.</p>

<p>She cast her spell over a wide circle, winning admiration
even from her enemies, and yet her life has been the
subject of a storm of scandalous reports and speculations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="A-Page_4" id="A-Page_4"></a>[Pg 4]</span></p>

<p>What was her exact relationship to the Duke? was she
the mother of the famous “Pamela” whom Lord Edward
Fitzgerald married? what was her share in the astounding
affair of “Maria Stella”? what part did she play in the
Revolution?&mdash;these are some of the mysteries surrounding
her on which M. Harmand, with the help of many unpublished
letters and documents, throws much new light.</p>

<p>The whole truth will probably never be known, but
M. Harmand in his elaborate biography gives us an
immensely fascinating and vivid story and unearths many
new details regarding her curious and romantic life.</p>

<p>Madame Judith’s memories extend over a deeply
interesting period of French history, commencing with the
Revolution that ushered in the Second Empire, and ending
with the foundation of the Republic after the Franco-Prussian
War.</p>

<p>Famous actors and actresses, poets, novelists and
dramatists, members of the Imperial family, statesmen,
and minor actors in the drama of life flit across the canvas,
their personalities being vividly realised by some significant
anecdotes or pregnant sentences.</p>

<p>Kind-hearted, clear-headed and brilliantly gifted, Madame
Judith led an active and fascinating life, and it is to her
credit that while she does not hesitate to tell of the weaknesses
of others she is equally ready to acknowledge
her own.</p>

<p>Herr Maxmilian Harden is Germany’s most forcible
writer. The outspoken criticisms on men and matters
which he writes as editor of the famous “Zukunft” are
read and discussed far beyond the borders of his native
land, and have more than once brought him into conflict
with the authorities.</p>

<p>In “Monarchs and Men” he gives us some brilliant
biographical essays on seven great European figures, most
notable among which is our King, Edward VII.</p>

<p>While it is often impossible to agree with Herr Harden’s
conclusions, one cannot ignore them, and no one who is
abreast of modern thought will deny the high value of
his virile essays.</p>

<h3 title="">THE STORY OF THE BORGIAS</h3>

<p class="center">
Illustrated&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Price 15/- net
</p>

<p>The striking personalities of the Borgia have afforded a
fascinating problem alike for historian, for psychologist,
and for novelist. A lurid legend grew up about their
lives, and for three centuries their name was a byword for<span class="pagenum"><a name="A-Page_6" id="A-Page_6"></a>[Pg 6]</span>
the vilest infamy. But in our own day a number of writers
have attempted to rehabilitate the characters of the Borgia
by that process of juggling with historical evidence
popularly termed “whitewashing.”</p>

<p>In the present volume, Mr. Fyvie attempts to present
the true history of this extraordinary family after
a careful sifting of all fresh evidence. No monograph
on any single one of the family can ever be satisfactory.
The lives and careers of Rodrigo, Cesare, and Lucrezia
Borgia are so interwoven that their portraits must all
appear in the same picture. They played their parts on
an elevated stage, surrounded by all the material, intellectual,
and artistic splendour of the Italian Renaissance, and
with the magnificent background of the Holy Roman
Church. They were magnetic personalities; and their
story is as intensely interesting and as profoundly tragic
as anything in the whole range of fiction.</p>


<h3 title="">ENGLAND’S WEAK POINTS</h3>

<p class="center"><i>By a German Resident&mdash;<b>Mariano Hergellet</b></i></p>

<p class="center">
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Price 3/6 net
</p>

<p>This little book is the outcome of close observation
during the social and business life of a German, fifteen
years resident in London.</p>

<p>Its conclusions are not flattering, its statements are
extremely frank, and it is naturally being read with
avidity throughout the Fatherland.</p>

<p>After a tribute to our many qualities, which are quite
unknown to or unappreciated by his countrymen, the
author postulates fifteen rules of life to which, he says,
the average Briton adheres, and he proceeds to describe
the results of these habits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="A-Page_7" id="A-Page_7"></a>[Pg 7]</span></p>

<p>The book concludes with an examination of the probability
of war between England and Germany (which the
author considers inevitable), and an endeavour to forecast
the future of the two countries.</p>


<h3 title="">IN ABOR JUNGLES</h3>

<p>In this volume, the famous war correspondent of the
Central News describes our latest “Jungle War,” <i>i.e.</i>,
the punitive operations against the Abors. Mr. Hamilton
tells the thrilling narrative of the operations in a picturesque
and graphic manner, and has seized the first opportunity
which has occurred in the history of the North-Eastern
frontier to depict the life of the wild tribes inhabiting
that region.</p>

<p>He also describes the characteristics of the country,
and deals fully with the many political questions centreing
round this mysterious corner of India.</p>

<p>Considerable interest will undoubtedly attach to the
statement by an Abor Gam regarding the murder of Mr.
Williamson, which is published for the first time in Mr.
Hamilton’s book, and which differs in many important particulars
from the official White Paper on the subject;
but the Gam was well known to the members of the party,
and there is every probability that his story is a correct<span class="pagenum"><a name="A-Page_8" id="A-Page_8"></a>[Pg 8]</span>
record of the events which culminated in the massacre.</p>

<p>The inclusion of a wonderfully fine series of photographs,
and the first published map of the country, showing the
proposed large extension of our frontier line into Tibetan
territory, gives additional interest and importance to what
is one of the most engrossing books of its kind issued in
recent years.</p>


<h3 title="">VEILED MYSTERIES OF EGYPT</h3>

<p class="center">
Illustrated&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Price 16/- net
</p>

<p>Though books innumerable have been written upon
Egypt, the life of the natives has scarcely ever been
touched upon, the reason probably being that Mohammedanism
has always thrown a veil over the inner life and
thought of the Orient.</p>

<p>Mr. Leeder has had the unique opportunity extended to
him by the head of the Islamic religion, of living for a considerable
period on familiar terms with Egyptian people,
not only in the cities, but in remote villages and in the
desert. He is therefore able to lift the veil of mystery that
surrounds Egyptian native life and to show us how the
people live, what they think and talk about, what are the
motives and ideals which shape their lives, and what
are the practices of their mysterious religion.</p>

<p>Mr. Leeder has the qualities of sympathy, insight and
unfailing patience, and these, together with a naturally
picturesque and vivid style, have combined to produce a
book which throws a flood of light on a subject of intense
human interest, and opens a new and fascinating chapter
of life in the East.</p>

<p>A series of beautiful photographs, illustrating the native
life and haunts of the country, is included in the book,
which no intending visitor to Egypt should fail to read.</p>

<h3 title="">THE NEW LADY BERINGTON</h3>

<p class="center"><i>By <b>Lady Angela Forbes</b></i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Author of “The Broken Commandment” and “Penelope’s Progress.”</i></p>

<p>A story of love and intrigue. The plot concerns the
struggle of Judith&mdash;the new Lady Berington&mdash;with an
influence which comes between her and her husband, a
rising member of the Government, and the action takes
place at various country houses and in London.</p>

<p>Judith&mdash;fascinating, impulsive, unconventional&mdash;gets
the reader’s sympathy at once, while the other characters,
including the Prime Minister and the famous political
hostess, Lady Mildred Stern (an old flame of Sir Philip
Berington’s and Judith’s bitter enemy) are crisply and
vividly drawn.</p>

<p>The smart, sparkling dialogue, the easy epigrams, the
by-play of conflicting ambitions, and the deftly managed
situations add materially to the enjoyment of a book, which
should greatly increase Lady Angela Forbes’ rapidly
growing popularity.</p>

<p class="center"><i>By <b>James Lancaster</b></i></p>

<p>A powerful, rugged story by a new writer, depicting
the life of an attractive, unbridled country girl. Susan
Murfield is a finely drawn character; the brazen nature,
the rebellion against the narrow existence of an obscure
and somnolent village, the yearning to taste life in the
glare and glitter of a great city, the artless attempt to ape
the actions of subtler and more world-wise minds, the
inevitable catastrophe and the return to the village home&mdash;all
are shown with a realism that must impress itself on the
most jaded novel-reader and keep him interested to the
final scene.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Author of

<p>Mr. Fletcher’s new novel is of the same <i>genre</i> as his
well-known story “The Paths of the Prudent,” which was
so popular a few years ago. A beautiful peasant girl of
seventeen, Valency Winsome, having half-killed a brutal
stepfather, sets out into the world to fend for herself.
She meets and travels with an eccentric youth, Hilary Crewe,
who is poet and poacher too, and who caravans about the
country peddling. His poaching brings him within reach
of the law, and Valency, unexpectedly left alone, drifts into
the hands of a wealthy young man, Jeffery Hessle, who
conceives the idea of bringing her out on the operatic
stage. Her adventures with him and his friend, Hadyn
Smith, a musician, her final revolt, and her eventual escape
to Hilary Crewe, and the wild life of the woods and heaths,
are narrated in a spirit of genuine comedy, while the story
is marked with all Mr. Fletcher’s well-known gifts of
strong characterisation and graphic description of life in the
open country.</p>

claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
